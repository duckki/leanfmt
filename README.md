# leanfmt

leanfmt is a structure-preserving code formatter for Lean. It parses complete
Lean files with Lean's own parser, preserves source tokens and comments, and
formats declarations and expressions through the `fmt` executable.

leanfmt favors layouts that expose the structure of Lean code. In particular,
leading operators connect continuation lines vertically while indentation shows
nested expressions.

## Formatting output

Before:

```lean
def parenthesizedConjunctionChain (schema : Schema) : Prop :=
  namesAreUnique (schema.allTypes.map TypeDefinition.name) ∧
    schema.objectType schema.queryType ∧
    (∀ typeDefinition, typeDefinition ∈ schema.types
      -> typeDefinitionWellFormed schema typeDefinition) ∧ (∀ typeName objectTypeName,
          objectTypeName ∈ schema.getPossibleTypes typeName
    -> schema.objectType objectTypeName)
```

After:

```lean
def parenthesizedConjunctionChain (schema : Schema) : Prop :=
  namesAreUnique (schema.allTypes.map TypeDefinition.name)
  ∧ schema.objectType schema.queryType
  ∧ (∀ typeDefinition,
      typeDefinition ∈ schema.types -> typeDefinitionWellFormed schema typeDefinition)
  ∧ (∀ typeName objectTypeName,
      objectTypeName ∈ schema.getPossibleTypes typeName
      -> schema.objectType objectTypeName)
```

Nested logical groups keep their local structure:

```lean
def leadingArrowExistentialApplicationWrap : Prop :=
  ∃ interfaceType,
    schema.lookupInterface interfaceName = some interfaceType
    ∧ ∀ interfaceField,
        interfaceField ∈ interfaceType.fields
        -> ∃ implementationField,
            Schema.lookupFieldDefinition implementationFields interfaceField.name
              = some implementationField
            ∧ fieldDefinitionImplements schema implementationField interfaceField
```

See the [formatting design](docs/design.md) for the complete rule descriptions
and more examples.

## Add leanfmt to a Lake package

Add the Git dependency to `lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "leanfmt"
git = "https://github.com/duckki/leanfmt.git"
rev = "vX.Y.Z"
```

Preserve the package's Lean version when resolving the dependency:

```sh
lake update --keep-toolchain
```

leanfmt uses one source release across its supported Lean versions and tests the
current toolchain and previous minor versions in CI. `--keep-toolchain` prevents
Lake from replacing an older project's toolchain with the version recorded by
leanfmt. leanfmt is then built with the project's selected Lean version, which is
important because it loads that project's parser extensions and imported
environments.

Projects that do not want leanfmt in their published dependency graph may place
the requirement in a separate development-tool Lake package instead. That tool
package should also depend on the project by a local path so leanfmt can load the
project's dependencies and parser extensions.

Then format files or directories through Lake:

```sh
lake exe fmt LeanFmt/Formatter.lean
lake exe fmt LeanFmt
lake exe fmt --recursive LeanFmt
lake exe fmt --line-width 100 --recursive Mathlib
```

For incremental adoption, format only Lean files changed in the current branch
or working tree. Check staged changes before committing:

```sh
lake exe fmt --check $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR -- '*.lean')
```

Format local changes since `HEAD`:

```sh
lake exe fmt $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR HEAD -- '*.lean')
```

In CI, check only files changed on a branch relative to `origin/main`:

```sh
lake exe fmt --check $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR origin/main...HEAD -- '*.lean')
```

Run these commands only when the `git diff --name-only ... '*.lean'` file list is
nonempty; pass unusual paths explicitly if your project uses spaces in file
names.

Directory arguments include directly contained `.lean` files. Pass
`--recursive` or `-r` to include nested directories. Hidden files and
directories discovered inside directory arguments are skipped by default.
Explicitly supplied hidden paths are still processed. Pass `--include-hidden`
to include hidden descendants during directory traversal. leanfmt uses a
90-character line limit by default; pass `--line-width N` when a project uses a
different convention. Multi-file package invocations use concurrent workers:
both default-environment files and files that require project-specific syntax
environments use the machine's hardware concurrency. Each exact import header gets
one short-lived worker process. Pass `--jobs N` to override the automatic count.
Pass `--version` to print the installed leanfmt version.

To preserve the next complete syntax node exactly, put `-- leanfmt: off next`
immediately before it. The marker works for top-level commands and nested terms:

```lean
-- leanfmt: off next
def handAligned   :   Nat:=
       1
```

```lean
def handAlignedFunction : Nat → Nat :=
  -- leanfmt: off next
  fun n =>
      n + 1
```

To preserve a manual source region exactly, wrap it in line comments:

```lean
-- leanfmt: off
def handAligned   :   Nat:=
       1
-- leanfmt: on
```

leanfmt formats parseable chunks outside the ignored region and keeps the marker
lines and enclosed lines unchanged, apart from the command's normal line-ending
normalization.

To verify formatting without changing files, use `--check`:

```sh
lake exe fmt --check --recursive LeanFmt
```

The command exits nonzero if a file would change or cannot be formatted, making
it suitable for CI.

## Status

leanfmt is under active development. Review formatting changes before applying
it broadly. Formatting is deliberately conservative: it changes whitespace,
keeps token text and order and preserves proof regions.
