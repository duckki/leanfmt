# leanfmt architecture

This document explains the implementation choices behind leanfmt. It is written for
contributors who want to understand or reproduce the formatter, not for users deciding
whether they like the style. For style rules and examples, see [design.md](design.md).
For build, test, debugging, and profiling commands, see [development.md](development.md).

leanfmt is a structure-preserving formatter. It parses Lean source with Lean's own
parser, converts the raw syntax into a lossless tree, asks syntax rules where line
breaks may occur, and lets one renderer choose physical whitespace and indentation.

## Design constraints

The implementation follows a few constraints that shape the whole codebase:

- Every source token must remain present exactly once and in source order.
- Formatting rules may inspect syntax tree shape, but they must not inspect renderer
  state such as current column, pending indentation, or output text.
- The renderer may inspect rendering state, but it must not make syntax-specific layout
  decisions from token spelling or node kind.
- Space decisions and line-break decisions are separate.
- Proof subtrees are preserved rather than reformatted.
- Unknown syntax must remain formatable and lossless, even when it receives only generic
  wrapping behavior.

These constraints deliberately rule out a classic pretty-printer pipeline that lowers
Lean syntax into an unrelated document algebra. Lean's parser tree contains source spans,
custom syntax, layout-sensitive proof blocks, and empty parser wrapper nodes. leanfmt
keeps that tree close to the source and introduces only the logical regrouping needed by
rules.

## Module map

The implementation is split by responsibility:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `LeanFmt.SyntaxTree` | Parse Lean source, keep token/trivia spans, classify delimiter envelopes, build the raw tree, and regroup selected raw syntax into logical nodes. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.SpaceRules` | Perform low-level token spacing and lossless trivia cleanup/reindentation. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.SourceBoundary` | Represent source trivia between tokens and expose comment, forced-break, blank-group, and ownership facts. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.LineBreakRules` | Define rule-facing segments, rule context, break points, node-kind dispatch, and syntax-specific rule authoring. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.LayoutPlan` | Resolve one rule into a typed, normalized segment plan before rendering. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.Rebase` | Represent one source/output layout anchor and translate source columns through it. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.OriginalTree` | Classify protected source-layout islands, resolve explicit island policies, and plan indentation-preserving source emission. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.Renderer` | Carry render state, choose among resolved layout alternatives, compute indentation, and emit tokens. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.Trace` | Record and format renderer traces for debugging. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter.Diagnostics` | Analyze compact bang syntax, code preservation, overflow, and missing formatting rules. |
| `LeanFmt.Formatter` | Public formatting API plus `Debug` and `Internal` namespaces for tracing, profiling, and shared pipeline phases. |
| `LeanFmt.Cli` | Command-line argument parsing, hidden-aware file discovery, check mode, and validation checks. |
| `LeanFmt.Main` | Thin executable entry point that supplies runtime hardware concurrency to the toolchain-independent driver. |

The test-only executable is separate:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `LeanFmt.Tests.Cli` | Fixture update/check mode, renderer trace printing, and profile output. |
| `LeanFmt.Tests.Main` | Minimal `fmt-test` executable entry point. |
| `LeanFmt.Tests.Run` | Minimal `testSuite` executable entry point for `lake test`. |
| `LeanFmt.Tests.Suite` | Root of the test library, containing unit-style formatter checks grouped into syntax-tree, basic formatting, expression/renderer, control-flow, collection/declaration, and CLI/architecture suites. |

Every imported test module is rooted at `LeanFmt.Tests`. A downstream package may
therefore define its own top-level `Tests` library without either package claiming the
other package's `Tests.*` modules. Lake package scope does not create a Lean module
namespace, so the namespace is explicit in the module names. The library explicitly uses
`LeanFmt.Tests.Suite` as its root, allowing all imported test sources to live under
`LeanFmt/Tests/` without a `LeanFmt/Tests.lean` forwarding module. Fixtures remain under
`Tests/Fixtures` because the test CLI reads them as files rather than importing them.

The Batteries environment linter lives in a separate Lake package under
`tools/linter`. That package depends on leanfmt by a local path and may pin
development-only lint dependencies. The root package and its manifest therefore
describe only the library and executables distributed to downstream users.

## Pipeline

Formatting a file follows this pipeline:

1. Normalize line endings to `\n`.
2. Parse the header and commands with Lean's module parser. The default public API
   uses an environment that imports `Lean` with parser extensions enabled. While each
   command's parser scope is active, probe every layout-delimited `let` body with Lean's
   term parser at application-argument precedence and retain the result as a parser
   fact. After parsing, read trailing-parser binding powers and registered command and
   tactic parser descriptions for the syntax kinds that occurred in the module. These
   facts let logical infix regrouping follow imported and locally declared operators,
   and let parser-owned trailing keyword clauses expose term or tactic-sequence bodies
   without putting parser metadata in line-break rules. The CLI first tries
   the default environment, then loads an import-specific
   environment when project syntax requires it. For multi-file package formatting,
   a bounded parallel classification pass reads each file once, determines whether it
   needs an import-specific environment, and records its source size. Files that use the
   default environment are sorted by size and spread across worker processes, keeping
   large files from collecting in one batch. Imported files are grouped by exact
   normalized import header, and every file in one group stays in the same worker. The parent
   obtains the target package's augmented environment from Lake once, then starts all
   formatter workers directly with that process environment. When imported parser-state
   commands require downstream native implementations, the driver loads the symbol
   libraries listed in `LEANFMT_LOAD_DYNLIBS` through Lean's dynamic-library API. It
   initializes parser plugins listed in `LEANFMT_LOAD_PLUGINS` inside Lean's importing
   context and carries both requests into every worker, keeping worker and
   single-process behavior equivalent.

   An imported worker skips the formatter's default `Lean` environment, reads its
   group's header first, and asks Lean to construct that one exact environment with
   `leakEnv := true`. Every file in the group shares the environment, keyed by the
   ordered imports and import level, and the process exits after the group. This
   matches Lean's one-module process lifetime and avoids reference-count work for an
   environment that survives until process exit. An internal bounded cache can retain
   Lean's opaque `ImportState` after the first direct import when explicitly enabled;
   the normal one-environment worker path uses Lean's direct importer. LeanFmt never
   inspects or reconstructs the state.
   Files with a `module` header use exported `.olean` data; scripts use private data,
   matching Lean's frontend. Lean therefore remains responsible for its import fixed
   point, public/private data selection, IR phases, user initializers, and persistent
   extensions. `LeanEnvironment.lean` is the narrow maintenance boundary for these
   APIs. Driver policy is deliberately separate.

   The automatic worker count follows the machine's hardware concurrency for both
   default and imported environments. The scheduler keeps the configured number of
   one-environment workers active until its queue is empty. Worker output is buffered
   and reported in batch order so diagnostics remain readable and deterministic. `-j`
   or `--jobs` overrides the automatic worker count.
   Setting `--env-cache-size` to a positive value enables the incremental
   prefix-state path for compatibility testing; zero is the normal direct-import path.

   The parent process keeps the default environment alive while imported workers run,
   so the peak is approximately one default environment plus one custom environment
   per active imported worker. Lean's runtime memory limit is per process and is
   sampled periodically at system-check points; it is not an aggregate budget or a
   concurrency controller. `--jobs` remains available when a particular project or
   machine benefits from a lower concurrency limit.
3. Convert Lean `Syntax` to a `SyntaxTree.Tree` of tokens and raw parser nodes.
4. Regroup selected raw nodes into logical `SyntaxTree.NodeKind` nodes.
5. Render the resulting tree using line-break rules and space rules.
6. Reparse and rerender until the text reaches a fixed point, subject to the
   hard convergence limit.
7. Clean final trivia and normalize the final newline.

Each convergence pass uses the same parser/tree/rule/renderer pipeline; there is no
separate cleanup layout algorithm. If a construct formats poorly, the fix is to add or
refine a tree grouping, a line-break rule, a space rule, or renderer state logic. The
renderer is the only component that emits text.

`Formatter.Internal.maxConvergencePasses` currently limits formatting to four passes. The
driver tracks previously seen results. A parse failure, cycle, or exhausted pass limit
causes a warning and returns the original normalized source. Fallback is deliberately
nonfatal so `--check-exception` and `--check-idempotent` can report formatter
problems without replacing a file with an unsafe intermediate result. The CLI caches
import-specific environments by the normalized import list to avoid reloading common
project headers for every file.

## Syntax tree

`SyntaxTree.Module` is the parsed source model:

```lean
structure Module where
  source : String
  rawSyntax : Syntax
  tree : Tree
  tokens : Array Token
```

`source` is the normalized source text. `rawSyntax` is Lean's parser output. `tree` is
the regrouped tree used by rules and rendering. `tokens` is a flattened token view used
for reconstruction and diagnostics.

`SourcePositionMap` stores Lean's precomputed line starts for the normalized source.
Renderer and diagnostic column queries share this map instead of rescanning the source
prefix for every token.

Tokens are exact source leaves:

```lean
structure Token where
  role : TokenRole
  kind : SyntaxNodeKind
  value : String
  lexeme : String
  leading : Trivia
  trailing : Trivia
  span : Span
```

`lexeme` is the text the renderer emits. `leading` and `trailing` preserve original
trivia text and spans. Rules must never synthesize replacement token text. Space rules
may clean trivia when using it as inter-token whitespace.

The tree shape is intentionally small:

```lean
inductive NodeKind where
  | raw (kind : SyntaxNodeKind)
  | letExpression
      (kind : SyntaxNodeKind)
      (bodyCanStartApplicationArgument : Bool)
  | application
  | infixChain (kind : SyntaxNodeKind)
  | definition
  | annotatedDeclaration
  | signatureParameters
  | structureHeader
  | structureConstructor
  | structureDeriving
  | parserOwnedHeader
  | parserOwnedBody
  | matchHeader
  | matchDiscriminants
  | matchPatterns
  | doForHeader
  | doFallbackClause
  | doFallbackContinuation
  | structureUpdate
  | ifThenElseClause
  | ifThenElseChain (kind : SyntaxNodeKind)
  | proofBody
  | derivingClause
  | unifConstraints

inductive Tree where
  | missing
  | leaf (token : Token)
  | node (kind : NodeKind) (children : Array Tree)
```

### Raw extraction

`extractRawTree` recursively converts Lean syntax into:

- `.missing` for missing syntax,
- `.leaf` for atoms and identifiers,
- `.node (.raw kind) children` for parser nodes.

Atom and identifier leaves record source spans through `SourceInfo`. Synthetic and none
source-info tokens are preserved as tokens with synthetic trivia and spans. A parsed
module containing a nonempty lexeme that cannot be recovered from its source span is not
safe to reconstruct, so the public formatter preserves that module unchanged before
rendering. Empty structural parser tokens do not trigger this guard.

`Module.reconstruct` sorts all tokens by source span and concatenates each token's full
trivia and lexeme. This is the basic losslessness check: parsing and extracting a tree
must be enough to reconstruct the source.

### Regrouping

Raw parser shape is sometimes inconvenient for formatting. Regrouping is the only phase
that changes tree shape, and it remains token-lossless.

Current logical regroupings are:

| Logical node | Why it exists | Expected children |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.letExpression kind bodyCanStartApplicationArgument` | Layout-delimited `let` needs a parser-derived answer to whether its body could be consumed as one more right-hand-side application argument. The active parser scope supplies this fact, so imported and locally declared syntax extensions behave according to their precedence without appearing in a formatter keyword list. | The original raw `let`, `letI`, or `letrec` children, unchanged. The raw kind is retained for ordinary rule dispatch and diagnostics. |
| `.application` | Lean parser applications are nested per argument, but formatting wants one function-application segment. Generated term parsers can express the same shape as a head and arguments separated by empty `ppSpace` groups; recognizing that structural pattern prevents continuation indentation from staircasing through the generated wrapper. An extension parser with no registered formatter can prove the same ownership when its complete descriptor is one tight word-like leading symbol, optional clauses, and one final term operand. Punctuation-only heads remain unary or extension-owned syntax. Applications normally own their physical start column, including applications on ordinary infix, pipe-projection, and low-priority-infix operands. A parser-described spaced tactic instead owns the operand continuation base through transparent parser and low-priority-infix envelopes. Two or more parenthesized proof arguments use peer breakpoints when the application does not fit. A parenthesized type ascription after the first parenthesized argument in the leading run retains its peer boundary, so it can move intact. Each intervening run of ordinary arguments receives a peer start after the preceding proof, so it retains the application base without forcing every fitting argument onto its own line. Other arguments keep ordinary flow behavior. `<|` remains exceptional only in its breakpoint policy. | Child `0` is the head, children `1...` are arguments in source order. Raw `null` argument containers are spliced. A generated spaced form requires at least two non-atomic argument trees and exactly one empty generated group between every content child. A parser-described form requires a non-atomic operand separated from its head in source. Direct tactic-sequence entries are excluded from parser-described application regrouping: the tactic retains contextual ownership while an application inside its final term remains an ordinary child owner. Ambiguous generated or extension-owned token sequences retain their missing-rule diagnostic. `return` wrappers move their prefix into a `.suffixGroup` with the application head, so ordinary and lambda arguments share the prefix's structural base instead of the function name's inline column. |
| `.infixChain kind` | Infix peers with equal Lean parser binding powers should break as one balanced chain, and renderer indentation should not infer peer structure from nested raw nodes. Same-kind peers remain the compatibility fallback when parser metadata is unavailable. Dedicated nested pipe-projection nodes use the same representation even though their operator token is not exposed as an ordinary binary-infix atom. | Odd-length array alternating operand, operator, operand. Operands are even indexes; operators are odd indexes. The outer parser kind is retained for rule dispatch. A pipe member with arguments is first grouped as one application operand. |
| `.lowPriorityInfixRhs` | A low-priority operator and its right operand need one local layout owner so attachment and operand alignment do not depend on token inspection or renderer ancestry. The enclosing infix chain owns the leading boundary before each complete operator-operand group, while this nested owner can introduce the sole discretionary post-operator boundary used by an infix family. A suffix operand retains its established suffix and original-layout behavior. For a non-suffix operand, the nested owner also formats an original child's leading boundary so the outer and inner breaks do not strand the operator; a delimited original-layout island can then reuse its existing structural fallback. | The low-priority operator followed by its right operand. Every operator-operand pair after the first chain operand has this shape. |
| `.calcBody` and `.calcStep` | Lean's raw calc trees hide the boundary after `calc`, wrap later rows separately from the first row, and put each relation, assignment, and proof in wrappers with no shared layout owner. Logical nodes let the term or tactic owner control the body boundary, the body own peer-row alignment, and each step own the proof-body boundary and the tail floor for its relation header. | A term-level calc or annotated calc tactic contains its `calc` token followed by one `.calcBody`. A proofless first term is attached to the keyword through a `.suffixGroup`, followed by the remaining body. The body contains direct `.calcStep` children. Each proof-bearing step contains a `.suffixGroup` header followed by its proof body. The header retains the parser's complete relation tree and `:=`; for `by`, `do`, and nested `calc`, it also contains the suffix introducer while the introducer's body becomes the step body. When that body starts with a parser-defined delimited tactic sequence, its opener joins the attached introducer and the remaining sequence becomes the step body. The step breaks its body one level inward and lifts the multiline header tail two levels inward. The retained relation tree therefore uses ordinary infix, application, and notation rules: its RHS has the usual zero-level infix continuation relative to the raised tail, while the proof body remains one level inside the calc row. The infix rule omits the first operator breakpoint for a bare placeholder relation, keeping forms such as `_ =` and `_ ≤` together while allowing the RHS and proof body to break normally. |
| `.parserOwnedHeader` and `.parserOwnedBody` | A registered command or tactic parser can declare a trailing keyword clause whose final term or tactic sequence is a body. Exposing that ownership gives the body one structural continuation base without making line-break rules inspect parser kinds, token spacing, or project-specific names. Only keyword-like suffixes from active `command` and `tactic` parser descriptions qualify; the concrete suffix must occur in the parsed node, so absent optional clauses and punctuation-only syntax remain opaque. Opaque core tactic parsers receive the same ownership when a `=>` header is followed by a tactic sequence. Term parsers keep their missing-rule diagnostics. | The body node contains one header followed by the complete body. A nonempty parser-described prefix becomes `.parserOwnedHeader`; its head attaches to its first argument while remaining header arguments retain ordinary flow boundaries. Bracketed tactic arguments therefore flow from the tactic base. A command suffix such as `where` attaches to the final header child. A tactic suffix such as `using` instead attaches to the body application head, leaving that application's arguments as structural peers. A detached tactic sequence receives the existing `.proofBody` envelope; an inline sequence remains compact. Attached `do` or `by` bodies exposed by existing structural syntax use the body node with their existing header shape. In a protected proof, a source-detached body marks the tactic as a layout owner so its continuation can be normalized. |
| `.indexedInfix kind` | Infix notation with an indexed operator needs one leading break before the complete operator without allowing its closing bracket to detach from the index. Recognizing the five-child delimiter shape during regrouping covers generated and explicitly named parsers while keeping delimiter spelling out of line-break rules. A structural RHS introducer inherits the relation base, including through one tight delimiter, so lambda and binder-operator bodies do not inherit the indexed operator's ending column. | The original five children remain in source order: left operand, an operator atom ending in `[`, index, `]`, and right operand. The outer parser kind is retained for rule dispatch. |
| `.delimitedCollection kind` | An anonymous parser wrapper can itself contain a complete delimited collection. Classifying that shape once during regrouping lets rule dispatch reuse the ordinary collection rule without repeatedly searching descendant tokens during layout probing. | The flattened delimiter, item, and separator children remain in source order. The delimiter kind records the parser-derived outer shape. |
| `.suffixGroup` | A header suffix belongs to the preceding syntax even when the parser stores it at the start of the following body wrapper. Grouping it with the header lets the body boundary break first without allowing the suffix to detach under width pressure or retain a removable source break. The same transparent attachment keeps a tactic prefix with the first line of its final structural proof argument while that argument's intact introducer still owns the proof body. Source-adjacent edge pieces of generated term notation use the same attachment. A generated prefix owner keeps its leading atom attached to the operand, but preserves an ordinary application as a separate child so its arguments retain their structural base. The leading atom is folded into the operand only when that operand starts with an opening delimiter, giving prefixed delimited notation one shared base. An adjacent identifier and generated suffix form one application head, so the following arguments share a structural base rather than inheriting the suffix token's column. A fixed extension prefix followed by a complete `letDecl` uses the same attachment, leaving declaration-header and value breaks with the existing nested owner. A final generated operand keeps its preceding atom, while interior separators remain rule-owned children. A term-taking tactic attaches a terminal opening delimiter to its tactic prefix even after the operand has become an application or infix node and whether or not the tactic also owns nested proof layout; ordinary applications and direct command terms retain an argument boundary. A single-token tactic wrapper attached to a direct tactic sequence uses the same group and forwards a nested layout owner, so `· exact ⟨...⟩` can format structurally without broadening unrelated protected proof islands. Nested `do`-notation declarations attach an existing `do` or `by` introducer to `←`, and a `do if` branch attaches `do` to `else`. A `by` branch retains the existing `else`-body boundary because Lean's layout parser requires its proof body to indent from the nested branch. An optional `private` structure-field value modifier attaches to its complete value; for a lambda it joins the lambda root so descendant breaks inherit the field-value base. The `do if` pass visits only direct clause wrappers, so it cannot rewrite a fallback clause or an already established owner. | The attached trees in source order. `cases` uses this shape for its discriminant and `with`; calc proof headers can include `by {`; generated notation uses it for pieces such as `#{`, `∂μ`, `∂.pi`, an attached `%` suffix, and declaration-like `doElem` syntax. A proof-valued tactic contributes its protected prefix followed by the complete final proof argument. |
| `.tacticAssignmentProof` | A tactic assignment whose value is a non-structural `by` proof needs the assignment boundary to outrank breaks inside its declaration header. Regrouping refines the ordinary trailing-proof split only when its shell ends in `:=`; `by` joins that shell and the proof body becomes a direct child. Proofs containing intrinsic `cases`, `induction`, `match`, or `calc` layout remain intact under their existing owner. | The assignment shell including `by`, followed by the proof body and any trailing syntax. The balanced rule keeps a fitting assignment flat and otherwise breaks before the proof body. |
| `.namedDiscriminant` | Elimination tactics and dependent conditionals parse a name and `:` separately from the discriminant. A semantic group exposes the lower-priority break before `:` without making the line-break rule inspect tokens or optional-wrapper depth. | The name, `:`, and discriminant in source order. |
| `.patternLambda` | A pattern lambda is a structurally multiline application argument. Giving it a logical kind lets applications break before the complete lambda while the lambda rule owns the alternatives, without searching descendant tokens for `fun` or `|`. The node uses its physical start as its base instead of inheriting an enclosing continuation base; the alternatives' zero-level breaks therefore round an off-column `fun` up to the next indentation boundary, while equation arms settle at their command-relative physical base. | The original raw `Lean.Parser.Term.fun` children, including the direct `matchAlts` child, remain unchanged. Known transparent application-argument wrappers expose this semantic role without separating their prefixes. |
| `.definition` | Definitions, abbreviations, class abbreviations, opaque declarations, and definition-like extension commands need one node containing header, assignment marker, body, and suffixes. | A raw `declValSimple` wrapper is spliced wherever it occurs among the command's children, including through the single optional wrapper used by `opaque`, leaving `:=` immediately before the value/body. A parser-generated `group` with that complete declaration value becomes the same structural owner, so extension declarations do not depend on their keyword spelling. A direct `whereStructInst` also establishes a definition value for generated command syntax; its leading `where` stays on the final signature line while its fields own the following structural breaks. Only a separate `Term.whereDecls` child is treated as an auxiliary declaration suffix. |
| `.annotatedDeclaration` | Every command form that accepts declaration annotations forms one flow, whether it is built in, introduced by a syntax extension, nested under a command wrapper, recursive under `where`, or a named structure constructor. Source breaks are preserved; otherwise the command remains after its annotations only when the complete command fits on one physical line. The wrapper also establishes the command-line base inherited by modifier and declaration children. | Child `0` contains the leading annotations or, when no annotation is present, the leading declaration modifiers. Any remaining modifiers and the command follow as separate children in source order. An annotation or direct documentation comment embedded in generated command syntax is extracted without changing that command's remaining child indexes; generated term syntax is excluded even when it carries a direct comment child. This applies inside scoped-command wrappers as well as at module level. A leading modifier container in an extensible command is removed from that command and placed before it, so the command starts at its keyword and both remain one flow. Optional wrappers around a recursive declaration's attributes are removed. Structure-constructor modifiers are separated from the constructor command so both inherit the structure field base. An inductive constructor keeps its `|` prefix outside the wrapper so annotations that follow it retain source token order. |
| `.signatureParameters` | Parameter sequences need flow behavior at binder boundaries without forcing rules to inspect raw `null` wrappers. | Direct binder/parameter children from declaration signatures, function binders, `termination_by` parameter lambdas, and `unif_hint` commands. When the `opaque` parser exposes a declaration identifier and its signature as direct siblings, the signature is merged into the identifier's existing parameter flow. In a termination lambda, the final parameter and `=>` share one child so the arrow stays attached while preceding parameters flow at two indentation levels. |
| `.declarationHeader` | A declaration's return-type boundary and value boundary have different priorities. Nesting the complete header lets it remain flat when breaking only the value is sufficient, without consulting the value's source trivia or inheriting the name's tail column. | Local `Term.letIdDecl` and `Term.letEqnsDecl` nodes place the name, parameter sequence, and optional type specification in this child, then retain assignment and value children in source order. `initialize` uses the same group around its name and optional type. Transparent single-content wrappers are removed when they lead to an explicit `doNested` value, letting that term own its body base; an implicit initializer command sequence retains its sequence wrapper and layout ownership. The header owns a possible break before `:`, while the outer declaration owns the break after `:=` or `←`. |
| `.structureHeader`, `.structureConstructor`, and `.structureDeriving` | A structure header may wrap before `extends`, but that continuation must not become the base inherited by constructors, fields, or `deriving`. Separate render scopes let each part own its break and indentation without renderer state exceptions. | The raw structure has a `.structureHeader` first child, ending in `where` when a body is present. It is followed by an optional `.structureConstructor`, the raw `structFields` node directly, and an optional `.structureDeriving`. Structures and classes that only extend parents still receive a header node. The constructor and deriving wrappers contain their original regrouped syntax. |
| `.matchHeader` and `.matchDiscriminants` | Multiple match scrutinees need peer flow boundaries after commas, aligned under the first scrutinee, rather than generic nested parser wrapping. A complete header also makes the owning `with` explicit when a discriminant contains a nested match, preventing the outer suffix from remaining on the final inner branch line. Term matches and match statements in `do` notation share the discriminant owner even though Lean gives them different raw kinds. | The discriminant node preserves alternating discriminants and commas. Only the ambiguous nested-match case adds `.matchHeader`, containing the discriminants followed by the owning `with`; it breaks before the outer suffix while ordinary match headers retain their existing suffix behavior. A match used as the first operand of a spaced tactic inherits that tactic's structural base, keeping alternatives aligned with the attached `match` introducer. |
| `.matchPatterns` | Multiple patterns in one alternative need peer/balanced wrapping rather than raw nested `null` behavior. | Pattern children from the `matchAlt` pattern wrapper, with a redundant single `null` wrapper removed. |
| `.doForHeader` | A `for` binder and its collection need separate LHS and `in` layout without teaching the renderer about `do` syntax. | The `for` keyword and declaration children before the loop body. |
| `.doFallbackClause` and `.doFallbackContinuation` | Lean's raw `do` tree may store `| fallback` and later commands in one wrapper. Formatting needs an ordinary optional boundary before the fallback clause and a structural boundary before the later command. A source-attached fallback after a simple single-content value may use the existing prefix-retention mechanism to keep `|` on that line while the clause owns a structural break before its body. A detached fallback or one following a structurally breakable value instead uses the parent's ordinary boundary before the complete clause. | The clause contains `|` and its fallback body. The continuation contains every following child that belongs to the surrounding `do` sequence. Both `let pattern := value \| fallback` and `let pattern ← action \| fallback` use this shape, including extensible `let_expr` syntax. |
| `.structureUpdate` | The source before `with` behaves as an LHS expression, while the surrounding braces remain an ordinary balanced structure. | The comma-separated source expressions as direct children, including their separators and the final `with` token. Redundant anonymous sequence wrappers are removed. |
| `.ifThenElseClause` and `.ifThenElseChain kind` | Ordinary, dependent, and `do`-notation `else if` chains must share one balanced branch decision without making the renderer inspect conditional syntax or ancestor paths. The retained parser kind distinguishes term chains from layout-delimited `doIf` chains without token checks. | The chain alternates clause headers and result branches. Term chains end with the final `else` and fallback branch; a `do` chain may instead end after its last conditional branch. A clause header contains `if` or `else if`, followed by a `.suffixGroup` containing the complete condition and `then`; nested condition rules therefore reserve space for `then` and cannot strand it on a separate line. A directly attached `do` branch joins that suffix group, while term conditionals also attach `by`; the corresponding branch peer becomes `.missing`, encoding attachment in the tree instead of a line rule. A final `else` uses the same ordinary suffix attachment policy. Lean may pack several `do` continuations into one anonymous wrapper, which regrouping flattens into direct clause and branch peers. The shared rule uses the same breakpoints for every origin, while `doIf` remains mandatory as required by its layout syntax and avoids unnecessary flat probes through large branch bodies. Only actual chains receive these logical nodes, so simple conditionals retain their established raw rules and source-break behavior. Non-chain dependent and `if let` forms use syntax-specific rules with the same owning-base convention. A `doIfLetBind` continuation inherits that base instead of treating its `←` token column as a new owner. |
| `.proofBody containsTacticLayoutOwner` | Tactic syntax after `by` or `decreasing_by` is normally one protected proof-layout region, including ordinary term proofs, binder default tactics, and termination proofs. The Boolean records whether the body contains a tactic shell that must establish structural indentation. An owning shell's nested tactic sequence receives a separate proof-body wrapper that carries any deeper ownership inward, so nested headers and alternatives can be corrected while leaf proof scripts remain protected. A detached `.parserOwnedBody` also establishes ownership; the same suffix written inline does not broaden a compact proof island. When one owner makes the surrounding proof structural, a non-owning tactic infix chain remains a nested authored-layout island instead of being reformatted as a side effect. Transparent single-content wrappers and a `.suffixGroup` beginning with a proof body retain proof-envelope identity, so an enclosing alternative still owns the structural break after `=>` when a nested trailing proof has been extracted. | The tactic-sequence children after the separate introducer token. For `binderTactic`, the preceding `:=` also remains a separate sibling. Nested wrappers contain the tactic sequence owned by the surrounding tactic shell. |
| `.tactic kind containsSequence isOwner containsOwner isSpacedApplication`, `.tacticEliminationTargets containsNamed`, `.tacticEliminationHeader targetIsNamed`, and `.tacticIdentifierClause` | Structural proof formatting asks the same tactic-ownership questions many times while probing layouts. Recording those parser-tree facts once prevents repeated descendant scans while preserving the raw tactic kind for rule dispatch and diagnostics. Core tactic kinds can establish that role intrinsically. Parser-described term-taking tactics additionally record that they are spaced applications and use ordinary application layout without losing their tactic identity. Their prefix descends through application and infix owners to the first structural head; another term owner joins the prefix in a suffix group. The operand's own rule therefore controls every available internal break without a renderer-level tactic-prefix exception. Extension syntax becomes a tactic only from its parser context as a tactic-sequence entry, so a similarly named term or command is not protected by namespace convention. That context is propagated through empty parser wrappers and tactic-combinator operand positions before generic spaced-application regrouping. When regrouping has already made a tactic combinator an infix chain, contextual annotation visits only its operand positions. A `cases` or `induction` owner sees one header child and its alternatives, so alternative boundaries are mandatory without forcing optional breaks inside the header. A direct target collection reuses discriminant flow, including the lower-priority break before a named target's `:`. An induction identifier clause similarly groups `generalizing` with its first name and exposes every later name as a flat peer flow. | The regrouped children of a core tactic or a contextually identified extension tactic. The first operand retains its structural owner with the tactic prefix nested in its leftmost head, or contains both in an enclosing suffix group; remaining tactic arguments stay direct peers. Infix boundaries such as `<|` therefore remain owned by their infix rule. Other children are unchanged except for nested proof-body wrappers introduced at owned tactic-sequence boundaries. An elimination header contains its keyword, target, optional identifier clauses, and attached `with` suffix. An optional default tactic receives a direct proof-body wrapper, while explicit alternatives remain a sibling of the header. When Lean's raw tree places a same-indented tactic-sequence continuation inside a preceding non-owner tactic, regrouping returns that continuation to the surrounding sequence; a deeper continuation remains owned by the preceding tactic. Ordinary parser wrappers may be divided before a complete direct final proof argument, including one enclosed by a local declaration. Terminal suffix and low-priority infix envelopes may expose a simple final proof body through that same path. Parentheses and projection suffixes preserve source order as structural prefix, body, and suffix children, allowing the proof body to use the tactic base while closers remain attached afterward. A suffix group with a direct proof body flows the structural owner before deciding whether the body fits on its final line; the existing prefix policy keeps a fitting first tactic attached, while an available boundary breaks an overflowing body after its introducer. Multiple-tactic bodies still require that boundary. A suffix group whose shell is an enclosing proof body inherits the surrounding structural base; a non-proof shell containing the spaced tactic that owns an extracted proof keeps that tactic-local base. Sequence-shell metadata survives extraction, and directly attached sequence wrappers remain intact. Proofs containing tactic layout owners stay atomic; other delimiters, nested term owners, tactic shells, and non-suffix token-bearing siblings stop the traversal. The proof introducer remains in the structural shell that owns the body. |
| `.derivingClause` | Long deriving-class lists need peer flow boundaries rather than an opaque optional wrapper. | The `deriving` keyword followed by deriving classes and commas as direct children. |
| `.unifConstraints` | Pre-goal `unif_hint` constraints use line breaks as syntax separators and must never be flattened into horizontal whitespace. | The constraint elements between `where` and `⊢` as direct children. |
| Termination suffixes | `termination_by` is an ordinary formatted measure while only the tactic after `decreasing_by` needs proof-layout protection. Both clauses align with the base of their owning declaration. | Optional wrappers under the raw `Termination.suffix` node are removed. A parameter lambda under `terminationBy` exposes its parameter flow before the measure. The outer rule offers only the break after `=>`, so that break is attempted before the nested parameter flow; the nested flow keeps the first parameter after the keyword and indents continuation parameters two levels. `decreasingBy` retains its keyword as one child and wraps only its tactic sequence in `.proofBody`. |
| Lake DSL commands | Lake package and library commands need their `where` configuration body to share the command base, while Git dependency clauses need one rule to own the complete `from git` header and revision suffix. | Optional configuration wrappers are replaced by their `where` and field children. Dependency-name, source, and Git wrappers are spliced into the raw `requireDecl` node in source order. |
| Multi-item delimited collections | Brace terms, arrays, lists, tuples, anonymous constructors, and matrix vectors need one balanced rule to own opening, item, and closing breaks. | Parser sequence wrappers are spliced only when they contain an actual comma or matrix-row semicolon, so delimiters, items, and separators become direct children of the original raw collection node. Unseparated custom-syntax fragments and singleton wrappers remain intact to preserve the established base for one multiline item. |

Tactic-sequence nodes are hard proof-extraction boundaries. Regrouping may enter
an owned tactic to expose its final proof, but it cannot absorb sibling tactics
or a following command into that proof. When a suffix group contains an
unparenthesized proof with multiple tactic entries, its rule mandates the body
boundary after the retained `by` introducer so Lean's layout scope is preserved.

Parser-owned lambda, macro, named-argument, and `suffices` categories may hide a
leading `do` or `by` inside their body wrapper. Regrouping splits that introducer,
attaches it to the preceding separator with `.suffixGroup`, and exposes the remaining
proof or do sequence as the body. A default-rule node with that structural pair inherits
its enclosing base, so protected proof emission rebases without losing internal layout.
Direct loop `do` tokens already have parser ownership and remain ordinary children.
Catch alternatives whose attached introducer is hidden under a term wrapper expose the
same header/body pair before rules run.

Regrouping deliberately avoids semantic interpretation. Infix peers are flattened
only when Lean's evaluated trailing parser descriptions report identical result and
left binding powers; the formatter does not classify operator text or reproduce a
precedence table.

The `letExpression` annotation is a syntactic parser fact rather than semantic
interpretation. For each concrete body, `SyntaxTree` runs `termParser argPrec` against
the body's source text in the command's current parser context. A successful prefix parse
means the body could continue the binding's right-hand-side application, so the rule
requires start alignment. A failed probe means the leading syntax itself separates the
body, so visual alignment is only preferred. The probe runs once while parsing the
command; rendering consumes the stored Boolean and never reparses the body. If the
incremental command parser falls back to Lean's full frontend or a source span is
unavailable, the missing fact defaults conservatively to required alignment.

The same parser-context pass records three reusable layout facts for every concrete
syntax kind in the module: trailing-parser binding powers for infix regrouping, the exact
single-operand descriptor shape used by command-like spaced applications, and trailing
keyword/body suffixes with final term or tactic-sequence bodies reachable from registered
command or tactic parsers. Descriptor
evaluation is cached per kind for the module. Regrouping verifies that a recorded suffix
is present in the concrete tree before creating `.parserOwnedBody`. Line-break rules and
the renderer never query the environment or parser metadata.

### Recognized raw nodes

Most syntax remains `.raw kind`. Rules can still recognize raw kinds when the raw parser
shape is stable enough. Examples include:

- module/header/import commands,
- source-adjacent extension index notation with a direct receiver and balanced
  `[` index `]` children, which reuses the indexed-term rule,
- declarations, structures, inductives, theorems, mutual blocks, and `where` suffixes,
- binders and declaration signatures,
- `let`, `if`, `match`, `do`, lambdas, quantifiers, and subtypes,
- structure instances, arrays, tuples, and parser `null` wrappers under known parents,
- proof escape hatches such as `Lean.Parser.Term.byTactic` and
  `Lean.Parser.Term.binderTactic`.

Binder-name lists are exposed as flow opportunities by rules on their lossless
wrapper segments. Explicit and implicit binders can therefore wrap names before
their type annotation, while untyped quantifier binders can wrap before the
comma. The renderer receives ordinary break points; it does not need to know
which parser wrappers represent binder lists. The enclosing binder rule owns a
separate break before `:`; the name-list flow does not reserve the type as a
same-line suffix.

The quantifier rule separately exposes boundaries between complete binder
groups. Those are zero-level breaks from the quantifier's binder base, so a
continued group aligns with the first binder, rounded to the indentation grid
when the operator starts off-column. It does not gain an extra continuation
level. Flow within one untyped binder-name group retains its own ordinary
continuation indentation.

Open-command identifier lists use the same peer flow in both `open A B C` and
parenthesized `open A (x y z)` forms. Their parser wrappers differ, but the list
rule owns the same break between complete identifiers in either shape.

The full dispatch table lives in `LineBreakRules.ruleFor`. If a raw node is not
recognized, `ruleFor` returns `none`, the renderer uses `defaultRule`, and
`--check-exception` reports the missing rule. For raw parser kinds, the report also audits
Lean's formatter metadata without using it to change output: it distinguishes an explicit
formatter registration, a generated `ParserDescr` fallback, and a kind with neither.
The missing-rule report intentionally filters unstable implementation-detail kinds such as
tokens, generated private names, custom term-notation names, and `stx` helper nodes.

## Space rules

`SpaceRules` is the low-level token/trivia transformer. It answers what horizontal
whitespace belongs between adjacent code tokens and performs the mechanical cleanup or
reindentation requested for a source-trivia slice.

Its main entry point is:

```lean
def interTokenWhitespace
    (source : String) (left right : SyntaxTree.Token) (preserveLines : Bool := true) :
    String
```

Important behavior:

- Normalize line endings.
- Remove trailing whitespace before newlines.
- Collapse excessive blank-line runs.
- Preserve and reindent comment trivia.
- Keep tight punctuation such as `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, commas, semicolons, projection dots,
  fully qualified name-quotation prefixes, and compact `!value` when source adjacency
  requires it.
- Insert a single space between ordinary adjacent code tokens.

Space rules do not inspect `SyntaxTree.Tree`, render state, or ancestors. Semantic facts
about a complete token boundary belong to `SourceBoundary`; it determines whether trivia
contains comments, forces a physical break, begins or ends at a blank group, and exposes
source indentation evidence. Comments and source breaks remain outside the syntax tree.

## Resolved layout plans

`LineBreakRule` is the rule-authoring representation. `LayoutPlan.resolve` evaluates its
context-dependent predicates exactly once for one segment, normalizes lexical break
boundaries, and returns a renderer-facing `LayoutPlan.Plan`.

The resolved plan uses closed policy types instead of independent renderer callbacks:

```lean
inductive Mode where
  | atomic | mandatory | balanced | flow

inductive BasePolicy where
  | local | inherited | rounded | inheritedRounded

structure ChildBoundaryPlan where
  index : Nat
  prefixPolicy : PrefixPolicy
  originalLeading : LeadingBoundaryPolicy

structure Plan where
  name : String
  mode : Mode
  sourceBreaks : SourceBreakPolicy
  base : BasePolicy
  tail : TailPolicy
  startAlignment : StartAlignment
  breakPoints : List BreakPoint
  children : List ChildBoundaryPlan
```

Breakpoint normalization also lives here. Tight postfix boundaries and trailing
separators are syntax/token planning facts; the renderer receives only legal normalized
breakpoints and does not inspect their spelling.

## Line-break rules

Line-break rules are syntax-facing. A rule receives a `RuleContext` and a `Segment`.
It returns pure judgements about the current tree segment.

```lean
structure Segment where
  parent : SyntaxTree.Tree
  start : Nat
  stop : Nat

structure RuleContext where
  ancestors : List Frame := []

structure BreakPoint where
  index : Nat
  indentLevels : Nat := 0

inductive StartAlignment where
  | none
  | preferred
  | required

structure LineBreakRule where
  name : String
  atomic : Bool := false
  formatOriginalChildLeadingBoundary
    : RuleContext -> Segment -> Nat -> Bool := fun _ _ _ => false
  keepPrefixWithChildFirstLine
    : RuleContext -> Segment -> Nat -> Bool := fun _ _ _ => false
  useExistingBreaks : RuleContext -> Segment -> Bool := fun _ _ => false
  mandatory : RuleContext -> Segment -> Bool := fun _ _ => false
  flow : RuleContext -> Segment -> Bool := fun _ _ => false
  inheritBase : RuleContext -> Segment -> Bool := defaultInheritBase
  liftsTailIndentation : RuleContext -> Segment -> Bool := fun _ _ => false
  startAlignment : RuleContext -> Segment -> StartAlignment := fun _ _ => .none
  roundUpBaseIndentation : Bool := false
  breakPoints : RuleContext -> Segment -> List BreakPoint := fun _ _ => []
```

A `BreakPoint` index means "break before child at this index." `indentLevels` is a
logical two-space continuation count. It is not an absolute column and not a token
anchor. Every returned point is an ordinary layout opportunity or a structural break
when its rule is mandatory. Break points carry no source-, token-, or comment-dependent
activation predicate.

Command sequences are the one vertical-spacing specialization. `LineBreakRules`
classifies module, header, import, top-level command, and mutual-command sequences and
catalogs command nodes as module keywords, public or ordinary imports, module docstrings,
declarations, or other commands. This exposes syntax facts without encoding vertical
spacing in every `BreakPoint`.

When the renderer processes one of those sequences, it renders each command once and
records whether the result is multiline. Boundaries known from syntax or the previous
command are applied before rendering. If the current command newly requires a blank
boundary, the renderer upgrades only its already-emitted leading whitespace. Import
groups use fixed grouping, module docstrings are separated from following commands, and
adjacent declarations receive a blank line when either renders multiline. Leading
comments and docstrings remain attached to their command. Other syntax sequences retain
the ordinary source-preserving boundary behavior.

`ruleFor : SyntaxTree.Tree -> Option LineBreakRule` is the dispatch table. It has no
ordered candidate list. A known node maps to exactly one rule. Unknown raw nodes return
`none`; `formattingRuleFor` maps that to `defaultRule` for rendering.

The rule module is organized by broad syntax families. Each family keeps its breakpoint
computations and `LineBreakRule` values together; generic wrapper rules and the complete
dispatch table remain at the end.

Rule-authoring methods compile into these plan properties:

- `useExistingBreaks`: source breaks at this rule's break points are tried before flat
  layout and can override fitting flat output. For a non-flow rule, one accepted source
  break activates the rule's complete break-point set; partial source layouts are not
  rendered. If that structural layout moves a multiline original-layout child and the
  moved child overflows, the renderer keeps the rule layout instead of accepting a flat
  probe that cannot remove the child's physical source break.
- `atomic`: the segment is always rendered flat internally. Its parent still measures
  its complete width and may break before it. Interpolated strings use this so `s!` and
  interpolation contents cannot split independently.
- `formatOriginalChildLeadingBoundary`: the parent rule owns the whitespace before the
  selected original-layout child. The renderer applies ordinary token spacing at that
  boundary and rebases the island's internal source layout to its formatted start
  column. Transparent wrappers use this for later children, so a source newline inside
  a type specification cannot detach its term from the preceding `:`.
- `keepPrefixWithChildFirstLine`: at a selected child boundary, when the child can format
  its first line beside the already-rendered prefix, delegate wrapping to that child
  rather than taking the boundary immediately before it. Such a rule requires a
  genuinely single-line flat probe and does not reactivate the boundary merely because
  it existed in the source. A comment at that boundary still activates the break, so
  its continuation indentation is structural. Refutable `let` fallback clauses use
  this to keep `|` with the fallback's first term; annotated declarations use it only
  between a modifier container and its extensible command. Named arguments use the
  same contract at their closing-delimiter boundary: `)` remains a tight suffix when
  it fits, while a forced comment or failed fit activates the existing base-aligned
  closing breakpoint.
- `mandatory`: returned breaks are structural and are applied without a flat attempt.
- `flow`: returned breaks are candidates; flat layout is tried first, then accepted
  source breaks, then computed wrapping. If the accepted source layout still overflows,
  computed wrapping adds breaks without dropping its accepted source boundaries.
  Structure headers use flow so fitting headers stay flat and overflowing headers break
  before `extends`.
- `inheritBase`: this segment uses the surrounding base indentation instead of its
  rendered start column.
- `liftsTailIndentation`: while rendering every child except the final child, establish
  the indentation of the following rule boundary as that child's tail indentation.
  Infix-like and flow rules lift continuations one level beyond that tail. Rules never
  encode prefix widths or variable depth contributions. Tail lifting does not replace
  a base explicitly inherited from the surrounding syntax.
- `startAlignment`: rules classify start alignment as absent, preferred for visual
  stability, or required by layout-sensitive parsing. The renderer decides whether
  padding is needed after measuring the nested layout. It may suppress preferred
  alignment immediately after `(`, as for conditionals and syntactically unambiguous
  `let` bodies. Required alignment remains active when Lean's parser reports that a
  layout-delimited body can start an application argument. Explicit
  semicolon-delimited lets use preferred alignment because their body boundary does not
  depend on layout.
- `roundUpBaseIndentation`: positive structural breaks start from the indentation boundary
  after the segment's physical start. Conditionals, delimited structures, tuples, arrays,
  and binding right-hand sides use this so contents remain one full level past an
  off-column head.
- `breakPoints`: logical child boundaries. Rules must not read renderer state or output
  columns. Syntax regrouping introduces a logical child when the raw parser shape does
  not expose the boundary a rule needs. Rules may declare that their candidate boundaries
  preserve authored breaks; `SourceBoundary` evaluates those physical boundaries outside
  rule callbacks and the renderer applies the resolved policy generically.

The default rule is deliberately shape-only. It distinguishes missing children, empty
leaves, nonempty leaves, empty nodes, and nonempty nodes. A nonempty leaf between two
nonempty node children is treated as an infix-like break point; otherwise boundaries
between present children are flow break points. It does not inspect token kind, token
role, or token text.

When a known grammar's immediate child shape does not describe its legal layout,
syntax regrouping exposes the semantic boundary or `ruleFor` selects a separate
syntax rule instead of weakening this invariant. For example, a notation whose
opening delimiter is part of one composite atom can be transparent so its enclosed
term owns the wrapping, while an indexed infix group offers one leading break before
its complete operator. Neither the default rule nor the renderer infers the layout
from token spelling.

## Renderer

The renderer owns physical layout. It is the only layer that emits text, measures line
width, tracks current output, and computes indentation.

Core state is:

```lean
structure RenderState where
  source : String
  sourceMap : SyntaxTree.SourcePositionMap
  output : String := ""
  currentLine : String := ""
  lastToken? : Option SyntaxTree.Token := none
  pendingIndent? : Option Nat := none
  segmentBaseColumn : Nat := 0
  segmentIndentation : Nat := 0
  layoutAnchor : Rebase.Anchor := {}
  tailIndentation? : Option Nat := none
  tailIndentationStop? : Option Nat := none
  tailIndentationAnchors : List TailIndentationAnchor := []
  breakIndentationShift : Nat := 0
  lineFitSuffixWidth : Nat := 0
  context : LineBreakRules.RuleContext := {}
  trace : Trace.State := {}
```

Key fields:

- `sourceMap` is built once per rendering pass and answers source line/column queries.
- `currentLine` avoids repeatedly scanning `output` for the current line.
- `lastToken?` lets the renderer ask space rules for inter-token whitespace.
- `pendingIndent?` records a scheduled newline before the next emitted token.
- The pending whitespace state can mark a comment-created tree boundary. This lets
  the renderer move the leading comment beside the preceding token when that line
  fits while retaining the boundary indentation for the token after the comment.
- `segmentBaseColumn` and `segmentIndentation` are the current segment's physical and
  logical bases.
- `layoutAnchor` keeps the nearest enclosing source-line base and its rendered output
  column as one value. Protected source regions move every source column through that
  anchor, so the two sides cannot be updated independently.
- `tailIndentation?` is the indentation floor inherited by continuation lines in the
  current segment. It is a single absolute indentation, not an infix depth counter.
  Child rendering restores the surrounding tail when it returns.
- `tailIndentationStop?` caches the complete segment's final child boundary. Balanced
  slices reuse that boundary instead of treating the slice's final child as the node's
  final child.
- `tailIndentationAnchors` caches each rule boundary's already-computed indentation. A
  non-final child uses the first boundary after it as the base for its contribution,
  falling back to the segment base when no boundary follows it.
- `breakIndentationShift` is the one upward translation shared by every breakpoint in
  the current segment. Computing it once preserves relative indentation and avoids
  recomputing the breakpoint profile during emission.
- `lineFitSuffixWidth` is trailing same-line width that a recursive child must leave
  room for.
- `context` is the rule ancestor stack.
- `trace` records optional debugging output.

`WhitespaceState` is the token-spacing subset of `RenderState`. Both real token
emission and suffix-width measurement use its single `defaultWhitespace` implementation.
The measurement path retains only this smaller state and the measured suffix width, so
it cannot drift into a second whitespace policy.

### Rendering algorithm

For each segment:

1. Resolve the segment's authoring rule into one `LayoutPlan.Plan`.
2. Record a trace entry if tracing is enabled.
3. Emit missing and leaf segments mechanically.
4. Ask `OriginalTree` to plan protected source-island emission and apply the returned
   text and token-state update.
5. If the plan is atomic, render all of its children flat as one measured unit.
6. If the plan is mandatory, apply all resolved breaks.
7. If the plan has no break behavior, render children in source order.
8. If the plan preserves source breaks, collect them only at resolved break points.
   For non-flow rules, any accepted source break applies all rule breaks. For flow rules,
   try the accepted source-break candidate once before flat layout. If it does not fit,
   retain that rejection and continue to flat layout and computed wrapping without
   reconstructing the rejected candidate. When a multiline original-layout child makes
   the source-break candidate overflow, skip the misleading flat probe and apply the
   rule layout because the child keeps its physical source break in either candidate.
9. Try flat rendering when allowed.
10. For rules that prefer child layouts, try the recursively rendered children when
    the rule-specific prefix remains flat and the complete child layout fits.
11. For flow plans that did not already try source layout through their source-break policy,
   try accepted source breaks after flat failure, then computed flow wrapping that
   retains those accepted source boundaries while adding any required breaks.
12. For non-flow plans with break points, apply all resolved breaks simultaneously.

Fit measurement is speculative. The renderer emits into an empty probe while retaining
the current line and pending boundary state, then records two facts from that one result:

- `flat` means the complete segment occupies one physical line.
- `fits` means the result stays within the configured width. It may reuse a multiline
  layout owned by an opaque or already-broken nested child without activating this
  segment's own break points.

An original-layout island can make a source newline physically unremovable even when its
parent rule does not generally preserve source breaks. If that island starts at a
configured breakpoint and the preceding prefix moved from its own source line, flat
measurement rejects the stale boundary. Ordinary rule layout then supplies the target
indentation before original-tree emission rebases the protected text. The renderer makes
this decision from boundary state; it does not inspect introducer spelling.

When a flow segment contains a multiline protected child, the complete segment is not
accepted as flat merely because the preserved lines fit. Computed flow then takes an
available boundary before that child, so a parenthesized multiline proof argument moves
below the application prefix. A directly attached body with no boundary before its
introducer remains attached. Zero-indentation flow boundaries apply the same invariant to
peer pieces, which is why a multiline command moves below its annotation without
classifying every multiline application as flat.

This separation keeps line-width and nested-layout decisions in the renderer. Rules
return only break opportunities and do not need access to either fact.

### Source breaks

The renderer discovers source breaks by looking between adjacent child tokens, but only
breaks accepted by the current rule can be used. Source indentation is ignored. Rules
for declarations, bindings, lambdas, and alternatives do not return break points before
`:=`, `←`, or `=>`; they return an RHS break after the separator instead. The renderer
does not inspect separator spelling. Accepted source breaks and computed rule breaks both
become `pendingIndent?`; later rendering does not distinguish their origin.
Blank-line trivia at an accepted break point is a source break too: the renderer
retains one blank line while rebasing the following token to the rule-computed
indentation instead of preserving its old absolute column.

Before applying a rule break, the renderer normalizes boundaries that would
separate a trailing punctuation token from its preceding syntax. The break moves
to the next content child, after the separator. This lexical emission invariant
keeps the default shape rule generic: it does not inspect comma spelling or
duplicate token-spacing policy.

For flow rules, accepted source breaks remain selected if their layout needs additional
computed wrapping; the renderer adds fitting breaks instead of discarding the accepted
ones. For non-flow rules, accepted source breaks are activation signals for the complete
balanced rule layout. This is a renderer invariant, not an opt-in rule predicate.

### Rule consistency invariants

Rules and regroupings should preserve these cross-syntax relationships:

- Non-flow means balanced. A non-flow rule never renders only a source-selected subset
  of its returned break points. Flow rules may select the subset needed to fit.
- A child that is structurally multiline does not fit as a same-line parent operand or
  application argument. The parent breaks before it through ordinary fit/flow logic;
  rules do not accumulate exceptions that prefer a parent break. Annotated declarations
  use the same flow behavior: a multiline command moves below its attribute.
- `:=`, `←`, and `=>` terminate headers. Declaration, binding, lambda, and arm rules
  omit breaks before them and expose RHS breaks after them.
- Header suffixes such as instance `where` and match `with` behave like assignment
  separators: they remain with the header, while their following body owns the break.
- Elimination alternatives align with their tactic keyword, and their bodies use the
  same two-level indentation as match-alternative bodies. For `cases`, the alternatives
  break after the attached `with` suffix; an unlabeled default alternative uses the
  same body indentation before later labeled alternatives return to the tactic base.
  A named discriminant keeps its name attached to `cases` and may break before its `:`,
  aligned with that name's base indentation. `induction` uses the same header and body
  ownership; a long `generalizing` clause wraps between identifiers without stranding
  the induction target on a line by itself.
- `let ... :=` and `let ... ←` use equivalent header/RHS layout for both identifier
  and destructuring patterns. `def ... :=` and `| ... =>` follow the same separator
  principle with their construct-specific body indentation.
- Peer syntax is regrouped before rules when raw parser nesting would create accidental
  precedence. Same-kind infix operands and multiple match patterns are examples.
- Match discriminants are peer flow items with breaks after commas aligned under the
  first scrutinee. Match arm patterns are non-flow balanced peers: all pattern
  boundaries break together.
- Applications do not special-case `basicFun`, structure instances, `let`, or other
  argument kinds. Their formatted multiline shape is enough to make the application
  break before the argument.
- Fitting constructors are flat. When the enclosing declaration and constructor both
  need breaks, the declaration break after `:=` precedes constructor-internal breaks.
  Anonymous constructors then use balanced item breaks like tuples and arrays.
- Inductive and equation arms inherit the arm base while their binders/patterns use flow
  opportunities. This keeps `|` at the arm base and continuation binders below it.
  When constructor documentation precedes `|`, the inductive rule assigns one base to
  the complete constructor and the constructor rule keeps both the documentation and
  marker on that base.
- A semicolon suppresses the otherwise structural do-statement boundary when the joined
  sequence fits; width pressure returns the following statement to the owning do
  sequence's peer base.
- Interpolated strings are atomic nodes: parents may break before the complete atom, but
  neither `s!` nor interpolation children break independently.
- Comments remain source text between the surrounding lexical tokens. Lean normally
  exposes them as token trivia, but it may leave a comment only in the physical source
  gap after an opening delimiter. Grouping and balancing must preserve that source-gap
  text and allow the containing rule to recompute indentation. A source-broken
  application argument that starts with a delimiter followed by a line comment retains
  its argument break so the delimiter and comment do not migrate onto the preceding
  application line.
- An intrinsically multiline comment makes its renderer tree boundary structural even
  when no syntax rule owns that exact source gap. This is independent of syntax kind:
  the renderer derives indentation from the surrounding tree, shifts multiline comment
  continuations by the difference between the comment opener's source and rendered
  columns, and separately applies the tree indentation to the token after the comment.
  A later comment aligned with that following token moves with the following tree;
  an authored continuation keeps that relation. A later line authored immediately one
  column left of the opener is treated as aligned and clamped to the rendered opener;
  a more distant line retains its distinct relative offset.
  A flow parent cannot flatten away this physical break.
- Line comments force the token after the comment onto a new line, but may remain
  attached to preceding code while that complete line fits. Block comments force a
  break only when their own text contains a newline. A one-line block comment may flow
  inline, with its internal text preserved and only surrounding horizontal trivia
  normalized; width pressure may still activate the enclosing tree's ordinary break
  or break between the comment and its following token. Syntax-specific rules do not
  inspect comment text or source spacing, and comments are not added to the syntax
  tree as layout nodes.

This separation lets rules say "this boundary may follow source layout" without letting
source indentation leak into renderer state.

### Indentation model

Indentation uses two concepts:

- physical column: where a segment starts on the rendered line,
- logical indentation level: `column / indentationSpaces`.

Breaks are computed by:

```lean
def breakIndent (baseColumn baseIndentation : Nat) (breakPoint : BreakPoint) : Nat :=
  if breakPoint.indentLevels == 0 then
    max (indentationPastColumn baseColumn) (baseIndentation * indentationSpaces)
  else
    (baseIndentation + breakPoint.indentLevels) * indentationSpaces
```

Zero-level breaks round the physical base column up to an indentation boundary while
respecting a larger logical base.
This keeps constructs such as match alternatives past a `match` that starts at an odd
column. Breaks with added levels use the floored logical base plus those levels. That is
more conservative for continuations such as application arguments.

For rules with `roundUpBaseIndentation`, positive breaks first round the physical start
to an indentation boundary. Flow rules retain the conservative logical base instead.

Child segment bases are derived from renderer state, not from token spelling. If a child
rule says `inheritBase`, the surrounding segment base is reused. Otherwise the child base
comes from the column where its first visible token will be emitted.

### Tail indentation

Tail indentation generalizes the indentation needed for a multiline left operand of an
infix operator. A rule establishes a tail for its non-final children through
`liftsTailIndentation`. A child that inherits that tail then adjusts its own balanced,
infix-like, or flow layout. The same mechanism therefore covers applications, binders,
structure updates, and other syntax whose continuation must remain visibly inside a
following boundary.

The model has three terms:

- A segment's **start column** is the physical column of its first visible token.
- Its **head indentation** is
  `indentationLevelForColumn (indentationPastColumn startColumn)`. Rounding is inclusive:
  a start already on the indentation grid stays there; an off-column start moves to the
  next grid column.
- Its **tail indentation** is an absolute logical indentation floor for later lines if
  the segment renders across more than one line. It is not a depth count and is not added
  to a rule's requested indentation.

When a rule sets `liftsTailIndentation`, the renderer caches the complete segment's final
child boundary. Every earlier child inherits the indentation of the following rule
boundary as its tail indentation. Thus a `for` binder is anchored by `in`, an infix
operand by its following operator, and an off-column child by the already-rounded
boundary rather than by the width of its prefix.

If the same rule also sets `inheritBase`, that inherited base remains the segment's
structural base. Tail lifting constrains continuations but does not rebase the segment
onto the physical column of an inline opener.

For example, an inner operator is lifted beyond the operator that follows its containing
operand:

```lean
- f firstLongArgument
    nextArgument
  - g
:: h
```

Here `::` establishes the outer tail. The left child containing `- g` lifts beyond it,
and the application inside that child retains its own continuation indentation. The
result is a hierarchy of absolute floors, not a sum of operator widths or nesting depths.

At complete-segment entry, the renderer computes the natural indentation of every rule
breakpoint. The least natural indentation is the base of that breakpoint profile. It then
computes the required profile base:

```text
balanced segment:       inherited tail
infix-like/flow segment: max(rounded head, inherited tail + 1)
```

If the required base is higher than the natural base, their difference becomes one
`breakIndentationShift`. The renderer applies that translation to every breakpoint in
the segment. For a zero-level breakpoint, it shifts the final rounded natural
indentation; applying the shift before rounding could make a one-level shift disappear.

Translating the whole profile is essential for balanced syntax. A structure can assign
one natural level to fields and zero to its closing brace:

```lean
-> {
      field1 := value1,
      field2 := value2
    }
    :: rest
```

Shifting those breakpoints together preserves the one-level difference. Clamping each
breakpoint independently to the tail would incorrectly align the fields with the closing
brace.

`tailIndentationStop?` records the final-child boundary of the complete segment, even
while balanced rendering visits slices of that segment. `tailIndentationAnchors` records
the already-computed indentation of each following rule boundary. A non-final child takes
the first anchor after it, merges that floor with an inherited outer tail, and receives
the result in `tailIndentation?`. Nested child rendering is scoped, so this state does not
leak into later siblings.

Transparent parser wrappers inherit a structural base only from an owner that defines
that relation. Structure-field default values inherit the field base, so `binderDefault`
does not derive proof indentation from the physical column after `:=`. A function wrapper
used as the right operand of an indexed infix similarly inherits the indexed relation's
base. Ordinary function wrappers keep their established local base; making every `fun`
inherit its parent both changes unrelated lambda layout and expands layout search.

The renderer computes each child's rule and breakpoints once before recursive rendering
and passes that prepared pair into the child call. Layout decisions therefore reuse rule
facts without inferring semantic behavior from the presence or shape of breakpoints.

### Suffix width

Recursive formatting must account for same-line suffixes owned by parent segments. For
example, when rendering a declaration signature, the parent may later emit ` :=` before
breaking to the body. The signature must leave room for that suffix when deciding
whether its final line fits.

`lineFitSuffixWidth` stores that extra width. The renderer estimates suffix width by
walking following siblings until the next active break boundary and stops at tokens that
are not suffix-eligible. The suffix classifiers live with line-break rules; the renderer
only measures with those classifications and the same whitespace policy used by actual
emission. Tight optional-access `?` participates in that measurement, so a following
defaulting call or projection can expose an earlier application break before overflowing.
A regrouped proof body stops inherited suffix measurement after its `by`
introducer; the proof renderer may still keep a fitting first tactic, such as `classical`
or `calc`, on that line. When measurement stops before a token or rule boundary,
same-line comment trivia preceding that boundary still contributes to the fit.

### Proof and original-source escape hatches

Proof subtrees, attribute instances, and unresolved parser `choice` nodes are not
reformatted. A choice retains its internal source line structure because changing it can
remove one of Lean's valid parses even when the token stream is unchanged.
`Formatter.OriginalTree` owns protected-tree classification, source-slice rebasing, and
emission planning. Classification still identifies a `LayoutIslandKind`, but rendering
uses an `IslandPlan` containing an explicit `IslandPolicy`: content layout, multiline
behavior, first-line breakability, relative-layout retention, pending-indent behavior,
anchor choice, leading-boundary ownership, and following-comment ownership. The renderer
retains that complete plan instead of repeatedly interpreting a classification tag.
Lemma and theorem commands use the same structural declaration and equation ownership;
only their proof bodies remain protected. A transparent owner such as `cases`, induction
alternatives, or a regrouped `calc` exposes its governing boundaries while leaf proof
regions remain protected. An unregrouped calc shape remains an original-layout
compatibility fallback and cannot justify opening its protected parent.
Its renderer-facing API returns the planned text, final token, and the one
comment-boundary flag needed by subsequent ordinary rendering; it does not own or mutate
renderer state. When the renderer reaches a recognized proof or attribute node, it
applies that plan. If the renderer has already formatted the boundary before an island,
that boundary's output column is final; original-tree emission rebases only the island's
source slice and must not apply the source-to-output shift to the boundary again.
A following standalone comment at or above the next source token's indentation follows
that token. When an island's policy preserves following-comment ownership, a comment
deeper than the next token retains the same relative depth as both move; no blank-line
exception is needed to establish that source nesting.
A multiline syntax-owned module or declaration comment stores part of its text inside a
token rather than trivia. Original-tree emission treats the complete comment source slice
as one layout island. Its first physical line uses the formatted opening anchor. Later
nonblank lines preserve their indentation offsets from the slice's common source
continuation margin beneath that anchor. This also covers a comment whose opener began
inline while its continuation began at the surrounding block margin. Its indentation
therefore does not depend on how the parser divides the comment into tokens.
The same continuation-floor rule applies to a multiline block comment inside any moved
original-layout island. When a continuation was authored left of the island's first token,
it may align with the moved island base but cannot escape to the stale source column.
A protected subtree that begins on a new source line inherits the source-to-output
layout-base translation established by its enclosing formatted segment. The output-side anchor is
the column where that segment actually starts, including when a child that began a source
line now follows a formatted prefix such as `:`. Every protected line moves by the same
delta. A proof island normally cannot move left of its structural proof indentation,
which keeps a block proof beneath its owning `have` rather than beneath a wrapped type
continuation or outside its declaration. This structural floor is retained even when an
unbreakable tactic line consequently exceeds the configured width. A source-emitted
quotation or compound proof-layout island may instead reduce a uniform shift by whole
indentation levels, never past its original source column. That fit calculation reserves
any closing delimiters and other tight parent suffix that must remain on the island's
last line; excluding that suffix would undercount the actual completed-line width.

Anonymous constructors and structure instances remain structural even when an item or
field contains a proof. Their ordinary rules own item, field, and closing-delimiter
indentation, while nested proof bodies retain their own protected source layout. An
application's first proof-bearing lambda is likewise structural; the narrower compound
case in which a later proof lambda follows an earlier multiline proof-bearing argument
remains one application-level island.
More generally, a rule with a zero-level breakpoint cannot be skipped when a nested
protected island retains a source line. The rule applies its complete structural layout
so closing delimiters and peer boundaries cannot drift. If a parent break moves a
protected proof-bearing application or other supported braced proof layout away from its
parent-relative source column, the renderer uses that tree's ordinary
structural rule. Equation clauses and other protected proof-layout shapes remain source
islands. The renderer also may retry an otherwise source-emitted complete delimiter island
structurally when doing so removes an avoidable overflow. Each structural path recomputes
the rule's breakpoints because protected-source emission intentionally does not prepare
them. This lets established collection, field, and nested-expression rules establish a
parse-safe block base without adding syntax decisions to original-source emission.
A protected tactic island receives the same overflow-only retry when its sole structural
content is a bracketed collection, possibly beneath transparent parser wrappers. The
collection rule then owns its item and delimiter layout; fitting authored tactic layout
remains protected. This covers parser-owned tactic headers such as `simpa [...] using`,
where `using` is also included in the parent suffix width so a collection is not accepted
flat when the attached keyword would make the completed line overflow.
For flow rules, a multiline protected child likewise prevents acceptance of the whole
segment's fitting multiline probe. When the rule exposes a boundary before that child,
computed flow takes it and renders the complete child from the selected continuation base.

When a multiline proof or
quotation begins inline, its later source lines use the introducer's source-to-output
movement, clamped to the island's structural indentation, rather than treating the
far-right first token as an indentation anchor. If formatting moves the quotation's
first token onto its own line, that first token becomes the source-to-output anchor;
continuations do not retain the column of an introducer that is no longer inline.
A terminal run of closing delimiters that begins on later source lines identifies the
quotation island's original base, so those delimiters return to the moved quotation's
base while the protected body retains its relative indentation.
Module and declaration documentation
comments are also emitted from their original source slices so their internal whitespace
cannot be changed. This
protects tactic scripts, term proof layout, quotation bodies, and comment text while
declarations around them can still be formatted. When an original-source child followed
its previous token on the same source line, it honors a pending boundary selected by its
parent rule; an existing source-line boundary and the child's internal layout remain
unchanged.
Qq terms use their own original-layout classification rather than the generic Lean
quotation policy. Their first line is indivisible, but their leading boundary is structural:
an application or other parent rule may move the complete `q(...)` island to its selected
continuation base without opening or reformatting the quoted syntax. That selected base is
also a floor for every continuation line in a multiline Qq island, so source indentation
cannot escape left of its new structural owner.
A protected proof-layout child that already begins on a source line still adopts a
pending structural indent from its parent before rebasing its internal relative layout.
This keeps nested record values beneath the field assignment that owns them. That
rule-owned indent is a structural floor for the complete island: fit recovery must not
leave later source-aligned lines at an older column, even when uniformly shifting a
pre-existing long line would make it longer. Equation arms therefore remain aligned
under their declaration instead of escaping Lean's layout block. When a parent moves a
protected layout to a new line column, that structural target applies to the complete
island, including every later equation arm and protected proof line in the block.
A proof body whose introducer starts its output line retains the introducer-relative
indentation, while an inline body that moves horizontally without an opening delimiter
starts at least one indentation level below its surrounding output layout base. A deeper
source indentation remains intact. An inline body immediately after an opening delimiter
retains its delimiter-owned source layout while it remains inline. If structural
formatting keeps the opener with a preceding suffix and moves the multiline body to the
next line, original-tree emission rebases the complete body from its source first-token
column to the selected output body base; sibling tactics therefore move together.
Delimiter and `where` proof-layout islands likewise retain their established first-token
anchor so their fields do not drift with a moved header.
An application whose argument is a proof-bearing `fun` is protected as one layout
island. The syntax tree owns the lambda shell but not the proof body's internal
layout, so moving the application and the proof independently can detach the proof
from the lambda selected by Lean's layout parser.

The escape hatch is intentionally narrow. If a non-proof syntax form is unsafe, prefer a
specific transparent/default rule or a grouping change before adding another original
source region. Tactic nodes identified by their position in a tactic sequence are
original-source islands unless they are structural layout owners. Core tactics also carry
an intrinsic parser identity; extension syntax outside tactic context remains ordinary
raw syntax. This covers extension-owned tactic grammars without cataloging individual
libraries in the formatter and avoids protecting unrelated syntax merely because its
namespace contains `Tactic`. Multiline custom braced term
syntax is also emitted from original source so leanfmt does not invent a layout for an
extension-owned DSL whose braces may carry domain-specific structure.
ProofWidgets JSX remains an original-source island, but its complete relative indentation
is rebased when the surrounding formatted layout moves it; leaving a JSX tag at its old
absolute column can change which tokens Lean's layout parser assigns to the element.
When the formatter-selected rebase would newly overflow an atomic JSX line, the renderer
also measures the source layout translated only by its parent layout's movement and uses
that candidate when it has fewer overflows. For `do` bodies, token emission records only
new atomic overflow caused by moving a source token away from a column where it fit.
The outermost eligible `do` sequence considers a source-layout candidate only when that
signal is present. This avoids both repeated nested recovery and reconstructing large
`do` bodies for pre-existing overflow that recovery cannot improve. Rebased original text
is reconstructed token by token so whitespace inside string and other atomic token
lexemes is never changed.
An original-source island whose own source slice is single-line still participates in
ordinary flat-fit checks, so inline extension syntax does not force its parent to break.
The island normally retains its source-leading boundary as well. A surrounding rule can
claim that boundary with `formatOriginalChildLeadingBoundary`; the renderer then supplies
the boundary whitespace and the island preserves only its internal relative layout.
`calc` uses explicit logical grouping instead of a whole-expression source island. Its
term or tactic owner owns the mandatory break before a proof-bearing body, the body aligns
rows one level beneath the rendered introducer line, and a proofless first term stays
attached to `calc`. A long single-operator step can break before its operator. Opaque
operands retain protected internal layout, while a regrouped application or infix chain on
the right uses its ordinary breaks before the attached assignment overflows. A
low-priority chain may keep `<| calc` after an indivisible left operand; when the left
operand itself has structural breaks, the outer `<|` boundary takes priority over
splitting that operand merely to reserve space for the calc suffix. Diagnostics treat an
unchanged protected calc operand shifted right by structural indentation as an
unbreakable-layout overflow.
The low-priority infix rule likewise owns the first line of an ordinary right operand.
When a non-suffix right operand is multiline, the outer infix rule breaks before the
complete operator-and-operand group. The nested operator-operand owner formats that
operand's leading boundary, preventing its own optional break from firing immediately
after the outer break. Layout-sensitive binding expressions such as `let` and `have`
then require start alignment on the operator line, and the operand's syntax rule owns
its internal body breaks at that aligned base. A right operand containing a protected
proof body moves with the same complete group; original-tree planning remains responsible
for preserving and rebasing the proof layout. Structurally eligible delimited islands
reuse their normal structural fallback when the formatted boundary moves them. Suffix
operands such as `by`, `do`, and `calc` retain their established suffix attachment and
source-layout handling instead of transferring that boundary. A protected operand whose
first source line cannot fit beside the operator, or whose first token follows a
line-breaking comment, retains the post-operator boundary and its relative source layout.
When formatting that boundary detaches an inline protected layout, original-tree
emission rebases from the first token only when the continuation was authored at or to
the right of that token. A proof continuation authored to the left of an inline
`show ... by` belongs to the surrounding structural owner instead; it moves to that
owner's base rather than being clamped against the former inline column.
That ownership propagates through leading-child wrapper chains and stops at the first
preceding sibling. A transparent type specification can therefore normalize the boundary
after `:` even when a known application or infix node wraps the extension-owned term,
without claiming spacing inside that known syntax.
Syntax-authoring commands (`syntax`, source-broken `macro` signatures, `macro_rules`,
`elab`, `elab_rules`, and `run_cmd`), Batteries
alias and library-note commands, and raw generated command syntax are layout islands for
the same reason. Generated commands first pass through ordinary regrouping, so a command
recognized as a definition, annotated declaration, or other structural owner does not use
this fallback. The fallback is based on the parser's generated `command...` kind rather
than the command's namespace. When such a command owns standalone trailing comments, the
original island carries a one-boundary comment-indentation marker so those comments retain
their source indentation without affecting the following formatted command.

If an unbreakable value already starts on a source line and moving it to the preferred
indentation would create an otherwise avoidable overflow, the renderer first keeps its
source column translated by the parent layout's movement. When a source-broken
application begins with an unbreakable qualified head and that parent-relative column
still overflows, the renderer may use the original absolute source column as a final
fitting candidate. Structural multi-token children never recover past a pending base
selected by their parent rule; they use their own break rules or accept the resulting
overflow. Single tokens, atomic rules, multiline atomic tokens, and quotation islands may
still use the source-column mechanism. Standalone comment trivia does not
make an otherwise valid structural layout fail its fit probe: the comment follows the
surrounding code's indentation even when the unchanged comment text then exceeds the line
limit. If reformatted code makes an attached line comment overflow, the renderer moves the
unchanged comment text to its own line without changing the following code's indentation.

## Diagnostics and formatter exceptions

Diagnostics are separate from formatting. The compact-bang diagnostic examines tokens
and reports ambiguous spellings such as `!f a b`, but it does not rewrite them. The
diagnostic API lives under `Formatter.Diagnostics`.

Formatter-exception checking is also separate from rendering. It orders source-backed
tokens by their lexeme spans, scans every physical source gap between them for comments,
then compares the code-token sequence and comment text. Line-comment text and relative
block-comment whitespace are exact. A uniform indentation shift of a complete multiline
block comment is normalized against the comment's opening column, allowing the comment
to move with its owning syntax without allowing internal relative whitespace to change.
The check does not rely solely on Lean's token-trivia attachment, because comments after
delimiters may exist only in those source gaps. The check also reports remaining line
overflow and missing rules with their source location and tree slice. Each missing raw
syntax kind is also classified by whether Lean provides a registered formatter, only a
parser-description fallback, or no formatter metadata. This is a read-only coverage audit:
the renderer continues to use leanfmt's `defaultRule`, and non-ignorable missing leanfmt
rules remain exceptions regardless of the Lean formatter classification. Preservation
normalization gives every code token and comment boundary one canonical space, so ordinary
formatting whitespace is ignored without conflating tokenizations such as `ab c` and
`a bc`. `ruleFor` returning `none` still renders with `defaultRule`, so unknown nodes remain
conservatively formatable. Generated private parser node names beginning with `_private.`,
custom term-notation node names such as `termℂ` or `Some.Namespace.termFoo`, token nodes,
and generated `stx` helper names are ignored by missing-rule reporting because they are
not stable rule targets. Diagnostic analysis and the exception model live in
`Formatter.Diagnostics`; trace and profiling APIs live under `Formatter.Debug`;
convergence and shared pipeline phases live under `Formatter.Internal`.

### Preservation-check limitation: layout-sensitive elaboration

The preservation check is necessary but not complete. It compares code-token/comment
fragments and a source-info-stripped syntax signature. Syntax-owned module and declaration
comments delegate their contents to comment fragments, which preserve text and relative
indentation while permitting a uniform column shift. Lean elaboration can still change
when formatting changes layout-sensitive source positions that are not represented in
that signature.

Mathlib validation exposed this class of bug:

- repository: `leanprover-community/mathlib4`
- commit: `81a5d257c8e410db227a6665ed08f64fea08e997`
- file: `Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Triangle/Removal.lean`
- original source lines: `179-186`
- failing formatted build target:
  `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Triangle.Removal`

The original source used a layout-sensitive `do` fallback:

```lean
meta def evalTriangleRemovalBound : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _zα pα? e :=
  match pα? with | none => pure .none | some _ => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(triangleRemovalBound $ε) =>
    let .positive hε ← core q(inferInstance) (some q(inferInstance)) ε | failure
    assertInstancesCommute
    pure (.positive q(triangleRemovalBound_pos $hε))
  | _, _, _ => throwError "failed to match on Int.ceil application"
```

The architecture response is to give `do` let fallbacks explicit syntax rules.
When a `doIdDecl` or `doPatDecl` contains a fallback tail, the declaration may break
after `←` and before the `|` fallback arm. The wrapper that owns `| fallback` plus the
following `do` continuation forces a break before that continuation. This keeps
continuation commands at the outer `do` indentation instead of allowing them to become
source text after the fallback expression. A fallback containing multiple direct
`do` items receives a structural breakpoint one level beneath the pipe; a single
fallback expression may move onto the pipe line even when the source broke there. The
later continuation still returns to the declaration base. The post-format build remains
the guardrail for preservation classes that syntax diagnostics cannot prove.

A refutable `let pattern := value | fallback` receives the same treatment when
the fallback contains multiple direct `do` statements: the fallback breaks after
`|`, its statements share the one-level-deeper base, and the successful
continuation returns to the declaration base. A single fallback expression may
remain on the pipe line.

Overflow analysis uses the formatted module's lossless token spans. A terminal token
exempts overflow only when the token itself is wider than the configured limit; a token
that fits by itself remains actionable because another rule may move it, unless the
formatted line already consists only of that token and tight excluded line enders at its
structural indentation. Comment-only overflow is similarly exempt when the same literal
comment line occurs in the source, even if formatting moves it to a deeper structural
indentation. New or changed overflowing comment text remains actionable.
Preserved original-source islands and syntax marked atomic by its line-break rule remain
exempt when they cover the entire suffix beyond the width limit. This keeps rendering and
diagnostics consistent for multi-token atomic syntax such as projection suffixes and
interpolated strings. A comma is also joined to any preceding atomic tree without requiring
a particular array or structure context. A `.suffixGroup` attached to an application makes
the prefix and application head one indivisible diagnostic span while the arguments remain
breakable. That suffix-owned application head is directly exempt because no rule can
separate its prefix and head. Parser-described spaced tactics retain a breakpoint before
their application operand and therefore need no corresponding diagnostic exemption.
An indivisible unit may be followed immediately by any sequence of tokens in the
diagnostic's excluded line-ender set. The set contains closing delimiters, commas, and
semicolons; it is explicit rather than inferred from parser context. Other overflowing
lines still indicate that the formatter left a possible structural break unresolved.
Formatting exception checks compare normalized overflowing line text with the source and
report only newly introduced shapes; unchanged pre-existing overflow remains available
through direct `overflowOccurrences` analysis without being attributed to the formatter.
The standalone analysis keeps layout-island and isolated-token exemptions, while the
source-versus-formatted comparison temporarily removes those movable exemptions. This
reports a movable quotation or isolated token that fit in source but was shifted past
the limit, without reporting the same pre-existing source overflow. Proof, compound
proof-layout, and protected tactic islands remain exempt: their text is emitted as an
indivisible source-layout unit, so no internal rule boundary is available to resolve an
overflow introduced by a required structural move. For an isolated token, the
comparison maps its token index back to the source and retains the exemption only when
that token's original physical line already overflowed; this covers an unbreakable
declaration name split away from an already-long command prefix.
An otherwise fitting source line that becomes too wide only because a protected island
receives its required structural indentation is also exempt when the normalized line text
is unchanged. A line consisting of opening delimiters followed by one indivisible token
uses the same principle: the delimiters do not make an unbreakable qualified identifier
actionable merely because the complete physical line exceeds the limit.

The CLI reports each exception at its file, continues processing later files, and
aggregates per-kind counts for a final summary. Non-idempotence participates in that CLI
summary even though its extra formatting pass is enabled separately. A file whose first
formatting result equals its source is already a fixed point, so the driver runs the
extra idempotency pass only when formatting changed the text. With diagnostic
checking enabled, `--check` controls writing only; diagnostic exceptions, rather than
ordinary formatting differences, determine failure.

## Why these choices

### Why not Lean's pretty printer?

Lean's pretty printer is semantic and elaboration-oriented. leanfmt needs to preserve
unrecognized syntax, comments, proofs, and exact token text in files that may contain
project-specific parser extensions. A source formatter needs a lossless source tree,
not just pretty-printed elaborated terms.

### Why regroup applications and infix chains?

Parser shape for applications is nested: `f a b` arrives like `((f a) b)`. Formatting
applications wants one head and a list of arguments, so `.application` flattens that
shape.

Infix chains are kept for balanced peer-operator breaks. Raw binary infix trees are
locally usable, but a long chain needs one rule decision over all peer operators. The
syntax-tree pass evaluates the active trailing parser descriptions once per syntax kind
and flattens adjacent binary nodes with identical binding powers. Thus `+` and `-`, or
project-defined peers, share a continuation base without a formatter-maintained operator
table. The `.infixChain` node keeps that syntax reasoning in rules and leaves indentation
math in the renderer. If an infix chain's right operand is an alternating
`term | term | ...` sequence, the infix rule exposes the right-operand boundary and the
generic wrapper rule flows at its bars. This is a parser-derived shape classification
rather than a rule-name or token-text special case.

### Why rule and renderer separation?

Rules know syntax. `SourceBoundary` knows authored trivia. `LayoutPlan` composes rule
judgements into a stable renderer contract. The renderer knows columns and fit. Keeping
those concerns separate prevents rendering from asking what token or tree kind it is
handling, while `Rebase.Anchor` keeps source/output column translation coherent.

### Why preserve proofs?

Proof scripts are dense, style-sensitive, and often use tactic syntax that changes across
imports. Formatting theorem statements while preserving proof bodies provides useful
formatting without imposing a tactic layout policy.
