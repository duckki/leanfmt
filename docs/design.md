# leanfmt formatting design

This document describes how leanfmt formats Lean source code. It is written for
Lean programmers evaluating the formatter and for users who want to understand
the changes it makes.

leanfmt is a conservative, structure-preserving formatter. It parses a complete
Lean file with Lean's parser, recognizes common Lean constructs, and chooses
whitespace and line breaks around the existing source tokens.

For implementation architecture, see [architecture.md](architecture.md). For build,
test, and debugging commands, see [development.md](development.md).

## Formatting at a glance

leanfmt turns a line-wrapped proposition whose nesting is difficult to scan:

```lean
def parenthesizedConjunctionChain (schema : Schema) : Prop :=
  namesAreUnique (schema.allTypes.map TypeDefinition.name) ∧
    schema.objectType schema.queryType ∧
    (∀ typeDefinition, typeDefinition ∈ schema.types
      -> typeDefinitionWellFormed schema typeDefinition) ∧ (∀ typeName objectTypeName,
          objectTypeName ∈ schema.getPossibleTypes typeName
    -> schema.objectType objectTypeName)
```

into a layout where each leading `∧` connects a peer operand and indentation
shows the structure inside each operand:

```lean
def parenthesizedConjunctionChain (schema : Schema) : Prop :=
  namesAreUnique (schema.allTypes.map TypeDefinition.name)
  ∧ schema.objectType schema.queryType
  ∧ (∀ typeDefinition,
      typeDefinition ∈ schema.types -> typeDefinitionWellFormed schema typeDefinition)
  ∧ (∀ typeName objectTypeName,
      objectTypeName ∈ schema.getPossibleTypes typeName
      -> schema.objectType objectTypeName)
```

## Design philosophy

### Preserve code, format structure

Formatting changes whitespace only. Token text and token order remain the same.

### Prefer a clear rule over a clever guess

leanfmt has rules for common Lean constructs. Unknown syntax is still lossless and
receives a generic structural layout, but leanfmt does not guess at the meaning of custom
syntax.

Proofs receive an even more conservative treatment. Proof subtrees are retained
from their original source so that formatting declarations and propositions
does not accidentally damage tactic layout.

### Keep fitting code compact

leanfmt uses a 90-character default line limit and two-space indentation. The
line limit is configurable for projects with a different convention. Most
constructs are first considered in a single-line form. A construct breaks only
when it is structurally multiline, an accepted source break applies, or the flat
form does not fit.

The line limit counts displayed Lean characters in the formatter's string
model: symbols such as `∀`, `∧`, and `→` count as one character.

### Make continuation structure visible

Indentation shows block structure under constructs such as `def` and `theorem`.
It also shows a local continuation when an application wraps:

```lean
def result :=
  veryLongFunctionName child children additionalArgumentOne
    additionalArgumentTwo additionalArgumentThree
    additionalArgumentFour
```

For infix expressions, a leading operator indicates continuation without adding
another logical nesting level:

```lean
def result : Prop :=
  firstCondition
  ∧ secondCondition
  ∧ finalCondition
```

leanfmt generally breaks before operators for this reason. Bodies after `:=`,
`=>`, `with`, quantifier commas, and similar separators are indented instead.
The low-priority application operator `<|` is the one exception: its grouped
right operand also exposes a boundary after the operator for protected source
layout that cannot safely move onto the operator line. Other infix operators
expose only their leading boundary.

### Preserve intentional source breaks selectively

Line breaks from the input source code are meaningful in some places and incidental in
others. leanfmt preserves a source break only where the rule for that construct accepts
one. It always computes the resulting indentation itself.

For example, a multiline function application may retain well-chosen argument
breaks after the flat form overflows. A fitting infix expression is flattened
even if its source had an arbitrary break.

Input source code with intentional line breaks:

```lean
      semanticEquality schema someLongContextParameter
        (normalize left)
        (normalize right)
```

We don't want to force wrap it like:

```lean
      semanticEquality schema someLongContextParameter (normalize left)
        (normalize right)
```

Definitions, theorems, parameter lists, and match pattern lists also have
specific boundaries where source line breaks may be preserved.

Source-break preservation follows the rule's layout mode:

- a flow rule retains accepted source boundaries and may add only the other boundaries
  needed by its fitting layout;
- a non-flow rule is balanced: once an accepted source break activates the rule,
  every break point returned by that rule is applied together.

This prevents partially broken branch, collection, header, and peer layouts. A
non-flow conditional cannot preserve only the break before `else`, for example;
it formats the `then` and `else` branches as one balanced structure.

### Keep separators with their headers

The assignment and arm separators `:=`, `←`, and `=>` belong to the header on
their left. Their syntax rules do not offer a break immediately before the
separator. If the right-hand side must move, the break occurs after it:

```lean
def result :=
  longDefinitionBody

let value :=
  longComputation

let value ←
  longAction

| pattern =>
    longArmBody
```

This rule applies consistently to declarations, ordinary and destructuring
`let` bindings, monadic bindings, lambdas, match alternatives, and
equation-style declaration arms.

The same header-suffix principle keeps `instance ... where` and `match ... with`
together; the body breaks after `where` or `with`, not before it.

The introducer keyword is also part of a binding header. leanfmt never emits a
line containing only `let`; it keeps `let` with the pattern or identifier:

```lean
let coreContext : Core.Context :=
  { fileName := inputContext.fileName, fileMap := inputContext.fileMap }
```

These separator rules are structural rather than renderer spelling checks. A
rule simply does not offer a break before its separator.

## File-level whitespace

These rules apply to every formatted file:

- CRLF and CR line endings become LF.
- Trailing spaces and tabs are removed.
- A run of blank lines becomes at most one blank line.
- A nonempty file ends with exactly one newline.
- Empty formatted output remains empty.

## Ignored Regions

Use `-- leanfmt: off next` before syntax to preserve the next complete syntax
node exactly:

```lean
-- leanfmt: off next
def handAligned   :   Nat:=
       1
```

The marker attaches to the next parsed Lean syntax node, not the next indentation
block. At the top level, it preserves the complete command. Within a declaration,
it can preserve a nested term such as a manually aligned function body:

```lean
def handAlignedFunction : Nat → Nat :=
  -- leanfmt: off next
  fun n =>
      n + 1
```

Use `-- leanfmt: off` and `-- leanfmt: on` on their own line-comment lines to
preserve a manual source region exactly:

```lean
def formattedBefore:Nat:=0

-- leanfmt: off
def handAligned   :   Nat:=
       1
-- leanfmt: on

def formattedAfter:Nat:=2
```

leanfmt formats the parseable chunks before and after the region, then splices
the ignored marker lines and enclosed lines back unchanged. An `off` marker
without a matching `on` marker preserves the rest of the file.

## Comments

Line comments, block comments, nested block comments, and doc comments keep
their text. leanfmt cleans surrounding whitespace and reindents comment trivia
when a containing construct moves. When a multiline module or declaration doc
comment moves, every line shifts with its opening delimiter so internal relative
indentation remains unchanged.

```lean
-- module comment

/- block comment -/
def f : Nat :=
  -- body comment
  0
```

A trailing line comment stays on its line:

```lean
def answer : Nat := 0 -- trailing comment
```

An authored trailing line comment remains attached when the line is longer than
the configured width. The formatter may break the surrounding construct at its
ordinary structural boundaries, but it does not turn the comment into a
standalone comment.

Comment contents are not wrapped or rewritten. Module and declaration documentation
comments retain their line shape and their exact internal whitespace relative to the
opening delimiter.

## Token spacing

leanfmt normally inserts one space between adjacent ordinary tokens and keeps
punctuation tight.

```lean
def identity : Nat → Nat :=
  fun x => x

def optionConstructor :=
  some .null
```

The main punctuation rules are:

- no space after `(`, `[`, `⟨`, `⟪`, `@`, or `@[`;
- no space before `)`, `]`, `⟩`, `⟫`, `,`, `;`, or `@`;
- dots stay tight in projections and qualified names;
- the two-backtick prefix of fully qualified name quotations stays tight;
- ordinary operators and declaration punctuation receive surrounding spaces;
- compact `!value` remains compact when `!` and the following token were
  adjacent; otherwise `! value` retains a space.

Source-tight edge pieces of generated notation remain structural units when
the surrounding term wraps. This keeps forms such as `#{...}`, `∂μ`, and
`∂.pi` from splitting at a boundary where the notation supplied no whitespace.

Braces retain the source's tight or spaced style where adjacency makes that
distinction safe:

```lean
{data := .null}
{ data := .null }
```

When a brace-delimited term contains multiple comma-separated items and does not
fit, it uses the same balanced layout as other collections:

```lean
{
  first,
  second
}
```

leanfmt does not infer that whitespace before a dot is always removable. In
Lean, a dot after an expression can also begin an anonymous constructor, so the
syntax tree and original adjacency are respected.

Interpolated strings are single atoms. The `s!` prefix stays attached to the
string, and neither source breaks nor width wrapping introduce breaks inside an
interpolation:

```lean
s!"expected three operands, got {repr other}"
```

The containing application may break before the whole interpolated string.

## Modules and commands

Imports and top-level commands start on separate lines. Their order is
preserved. A `module` command, consecutive `public import` commands,
consecutive ordinary imports, and the following command form separate groups
with one blank line. Imports within one group have no blank lines between them.

```lean
module

public import Lean
public import Std

import Lean.Elab
import Lean.Parser

/-! # Example -/

namespace Example

def answer : Nat := 42

end Example
```

A module docstring is separated from the first declaration. Leading comments
and declaration docstrings stay attached to the command they describe.

Multiline top-level declarations have a blank line between them and adjacent
declarations. Short one-line declarations may remain grouped without blank
lines:

```lean
structure Point where
  x : Nat
  y : Nat

def origin := Point.mk 0 0
def unitX := Point.mk 1 0

structure Segment where
  start : Point
  stop : Point
```

Existing blank lines may still separate short declaration groups and other
top-level commands.

The same declaration boundary applies inside a `mutual` block. Adjacent multiline
declarations are separated even when the input omitted the blank line:

```lean
mutual
  theorem first : True := by
    trivial

  theorem second : True := by
    trivial
end
```

A long individual import is not split internally. Syntax declarations and
other command forms keep their tokens and use either an explicit command rule
or the generic structural layout.

```lean
import Very.Long.Module.Name.ThatRemainsOneImportCommand

syntax "widget" : term
```

Long `assert_not_exists` commands put their identifier list on continuation
lines and fill each line up to the configured width:

```lean
assert_not_exists
  FirstForbiddenDeclaration SecondForbiddenDeclaration ThirdForbiddenDeclaration
  FourthForbiddenDeclaration
```

Lake package commands keep `where` on the header and indent configuration fields one
level. A multiline Git dependency breaks after `git`, and its revision separator keeps
ordinary source spacing:

```lean
package example where
  srcDir := "."

require mathlib from git
  "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git" @ "v4.32.0"
```

An attribute may share the line of any top-level command that accepts declaration
attributes when the source keeps them together and the complete command fits on
that line. This applies equally to built-in declarations and commands added by
syntax extensions:

```lean
@[simp] theorem eraseP_nil : [].eraseP p = [] := rfl
```

A source break between an attribute and its command is preserved. A multiline
command breaks after the attribute before trying breaks inside the command:

```lean
@[ext]
structure Point where
  x : Nat
```

For example, a declaration that wraps because of width moves below its attribute:

```lean
@[simp]
theorem theoremNameWithEnoughCharactersToRequireAnAttributeHeaderBreak
    (value : VeryLongInputTypeName)
    : VeryLongOutputTypeName := proof
```

Keyword modifiers remain on the declaration header:

```lean
private theorem helper : True := by
  trivial
```

Continuation indentation is measured from the beginning of the command line,
not from the declaration keyword after its modifiers:

```lean
private inductive Aligned : List α -> Prop where
  | nil : Aligned []
  | cons : Aligned values -> Aligned (value :: values)
```

## Declaration headers

### Names

A declaration name normally stays with its command keyword and modifiers. If that
prefix makes the name overflow, the name moves to the ordinary four-space declaration
continuation. Parameters and the return type then keep using the same declaration base:

```lean
private theorem
    theoremNameThatCannotShareThePrivateTheoremHeader
    (value : InputType)
    : OutputType := proof
```

This name flow is shared by definitions, theorems, structures, inductives, and other
commands that use Lean's declaration identifier syntax.

### Parameters

Declaration parameters flow at binder boundaries. leanfmt keeps as many
binders as fit and places later binders on continuation lines indented four
spaces from the declaration base.

```lean
def lookupObject (schema : Schema) (typeName : Name)
    (fallback : ObjectType) : Option ObjectType :=
  body
```

Existing parameter breaks can be retained after the header no longer fits.

```lean
def shapeExample (arg1 : VeryLongTypeNameUsedForLayout)
    (arg2 : AnotherVeryLongTypeNameUsedForLayout)
    : VeryLongReturnInputTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
      -> VeryLongReturnOutputTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting :=
  body
```
Grouping inside a binder remains logically intact, such as `(x y : Nat)` and
`{ObjectRef : Type}`. A long sequence of names may wrap within the same pair of
delimiters; it is not rewritten into separate binders.

```lean
def compareSelections
    (rootSelectionSet leftInitialSelectionSet rightInitialSelectionSet
      leftCurrentSelectionSet rightCurrentSelectionSet
      : List Selection) :=
  body
```

If one binder is too long, it may break before its type annotation:

```lean
def example
    (hknown
      : ∀ name value,
          predicate name value) :=
  body
```

### Return types

When a declaration header is too long, the return type moves to a line beginning
with `:`. This line uses the declaration continuation indentation rather than
the body indentation.

```lean
def lookupVariableValue? (variableValues : VariableValues) (name : Name)
    : Option InputValue :=
  body
```

An author may attach a result comment to the declaration colon. A detached line
comment between the colon and result type moves beside the colon when the
complete `: -- comment` line fits. The comment's own newline then establishes
the indented result continuation:

```lean
theorem projective_of_lifting_property (h : LiftingProperty P)
    : -- The lifting property makes `P` projective.
      Projective R P := by
  ...
```

Comments immediately inside a delimiter follow the same boundary behavior. A
line comment or multiline block comment may move beside the opening delimiter;
its intrinsic newline establishes the body indentation. A single-line block
comment remains ordinary inline trivia while the complete tree fits. Under
width pressure, the renderer may use the enclosing tree's ordinary break and,
when needed, break between the comment and its following token.

Long function return types break before arrows:

```lean
def nestedReturnChain
    : A -> VeryLongIntermediateReturnTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
      -> VeryLongFinalReturnTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting :=
  body
```

Return-type arrow chains use flow layout: only the boundaries required to fit
the line are broken.

### Definition bodies

A body that does not fit on the header starts after `:=` and is indented one
level:

```lean
def wrappedApplicationArgument : Result :=
  singleFieldResult responseName
    (completeValue schema resolvers variableValues
      fuel' fieldDefinition.outputType
      (field :: fields) resolved)
```

An existing break immediately after `:=` is an accepted source break, even when
the body itself would fit on the header. This allows a project to retain a
deliberately multiline definition style.

Bodies beginning with `do` or `by` keep that keyword attached to `:=`; the
nested construct owns its body layout.

```lean
def lookupObject (schema : Schema) (typeName : Name) : Option ObjectType := do
  body
```

### `where` blocks

`where` returns to the declaration's base column. Nested declarations are
indented one level.

```lean
def outer : Nat :=
  inner
where
  inner : Nat := 0
```

For a nested declaration whose value already begins on the next source line,
the assignment boundary is tried before splitting its fitting signature:

```lean
def outer : Nat := helper 0
where
  helper (n : Nat) : Nat → Nat :=
    computeLongResult n anotherArgument
```

Termination clauses follow the same ownership rule. `termination_by` and
`decreasing_by` return to the base column of the declaration they modify. A
fitting `termination_by` parameter lambda and measure stay on one line:

```lean
termination_by patternList => body
```

When the clause does not fit, the first break is after `=>`; the measure is
indented one level:

```lean
termination_by patternList =>
  body
```

If the parameter header still does not fit, its names flow at two indentation
levels. The first names remain after `termination_by`, and `=>` remains attached
to the final parameter. The four-space parameter continuation is deliberately
distinct from the two-space measure:

```lean
termination_by firstPattern secondPattern thirdPattern
    fourthPattern =>
  body
```

The tactic after `decreasing_by` retains its source layout, rebased beneath the
formatted clause.

```lean
def outer (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  helper n
termination_by n
decreasing_by
  exact outerProof
where
  helper (n : Nat) : Nat := helper (n - 1)
  termination_by n
  decreasing_by
    exact helperProof
```

```lean
termination_by _schema _variableDefinitions fragments _parentType selection _field _hvalid
    _hbodies _hfield =>
  (fragments.length, sizeOf selection, 0)
```

Declarations inside `mutual` remain peers at the mutual-body indentation even
when a preceding declaration ends with a termination clause. A declaration's
documentation comment shares that same base:

```lean
mutual
  def first (n : Nat) : Nat := second n
  termination_by n
  /-- Calls `first`. -/
  def second (n : Nat) : Nat := first n
  termination_by n
end
```

### Theorems and proofs

Theorem headers use the same parameter and return-type rules as definitions.
In a simple theorem, `:= by` remains on the final header line:

```lean
theorem theoremArrowChain (h : HypothesisWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting)
    : FirstCondition -> SecondCondition -> FinalCondition := by
  exact proof
```

The source text of theorem proof values is preserved. Definitions and
abbreviations containing proof subtrees are preserved as a whole. The tactic
body after `decreasing_by` is protected separately from the formatted
termination-clause keywords and measure. leanfmt can therefore format
surrounding declarations and propositions without imposing a tactic style.

Equation-style theorem and definition arms begin on their own lines and use the
declaration body indentation.

```lean
theorem equations : List Nat -> True
  | [] => by
      trivial
  | _ :: rest => by
      trivial
```

## Structures, inductives, and mutual declarations

Structure fields start on separate lines under `where`:

```lean
structure Point where
  x : Nat
  y : Nat
```

Named structure constructors use the same field base. Constructor documentation and
modifiers move with the constructor:

```lean
structure Wrapped where
  /-- Build a wrapped value. -/
  private mk ::
  value : Nat
```

The field break does not force a fitting `extends` clause onto a continuation
line:

```lean
structure Candidate extends CandidateKey where
  occurrenceCount : Nat
```

This also applies to fitting parameterized headers:

```lean
structure ParameterizedCandidate (α : Type) extends CandidateKey α where
  occurrenceCount : Nat
```

When an `extends` list itself wraps, parent types flow after commas one level
beyond the `extends` line:

```lean
structure MultipleParentStructure (A : Type)
    extends FirstLongParentName A, SecondLongParentName A, ThirdLongParentName A,
      FourthLongParentName A, FifthLongParentName A where
```

Long field types use the same binder/type continuation principles as other
declarations.

```lean
structure ResolverFixture where
  resolve
    : Name -> Name -> List Argument
      -> Option ResponseValue
```

Inductive constructors also start on separate lines:

```lean
inductive Color where
  | red
  | green
  | blue
```

Constructor parameters flow at binder boundaries. A long constructor result
type moves to a leading `:` continuation line.

```lean
inductive ConstructorResultLayout where
  | intro (fields : List Field)
    : ConstructorResultLayoutForInput schema (ConstructorValue.object fields)
        (TypeRef.named typeName)
```

The arm base remains stable while long constructor binders flow beneath it:

```lean
inductive ConstructorBinderLayout where
  | intro (first : FirstTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting)
    (second : SecondTypeWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting)
    : Result
```

This is the same base/flow relationship used by equation arms: `|` owns the
arm base, while binders and patterns own continuation opportunities.

`deriving` begins on its own line when it follows a multiline structure or
inductive declaration:

```lean
structure Response where
  data : Nat
  errors : Nat := 0
deriving Repr
```

Mutual declaration bodies are indented beneath `mutual`, and `end` returns to
the `mutual` column:

```lean
mutual
  def first : Nat := second
  def second : Nat := first
end
```

## Function applications

Applications use flow layout. The function and the longest fitting prefix of
arguments remain on the current line; later arguments wrap with one additional
indentation level.

```lean
veryLongFunctionName child children additionalArgumentOne
  additionalArgumentTwo additionalArgumentThree
```

Lean's `leading_parser` syntax describes a parser constructor with ordinary
positional arguments, so those arguments use the same flow layout instead of
letting a nested parser-combinator expression establish their indentation.

In a `do` conditional with an `if let ... ← action` condition, an overflowing
action breaks from the conditional's base:

```lean
if let some value ←
    lookupLongOptionalValue firstArgument secondArgument then
  use value
```

Nested applications choose their continuation from the nested application's
structural base rather than aligning every line under the first argument:

```lean
singleFieldResult responseName
  (completeValue schema resolvers variableValues
    fuel' fieldDefinition.outputType
    (field :: fields) resolved)
```

If the flat application overflows, valid argument-boundary breaks from the
source are tried before automatic flow wrapping. Original indentation is
ignored and recomputed.

An argument whose formatted shape spans multiple lines is treated as not
fitting on the current line. The application therefore breaks before that
argument, including structured arguments such as `let`, `if`, `match`, and
structure instances. No special-case preference between parent and child
breaks is needed.

A multiline named argument keeps its closing parenthesis attached to the final
line of the value:

```lean
Nat.recOn
  (motive :=
    fun n =>
      Nat)
  0
  fun _ ih => ih
```

When a trailing line comment prevents attachment, the closing parenthesis moves
to a new line at the opening parenthesis's column.

Projection chains do not break before a dot. The application around a
projection may still wrap:

```lean
def postfixProjection (schema : Schema) (typeName objectName : Name) :=
  (schema.getPossibleTypes typeName).contains objectName
```

## Unary prefix operators

A unary prefix operator stays on the first line of its operand. If the operand
is a long application, the application wraps at its own argument boundaries;
the formatter does not leave the prefix on a line by itself.

```lean
theorem duplicateArgumentNamesRejected
    : ¬ GraphQL.Validation.argumentsValid sampleSchema
          [testEpisodeArgumentDefinition] [] duplicateEpisodeArguments := by
  exact proof
```

This applies consistently to logical negation `¬`, compact bang `!`, numeric
negation `-`, and bitwise complement `~~~`. Postfix operators follow their own
right-attached layout.

## Tail indentation

leanfmt breaks before an infix operator so the operator visually connects the
lines in its chain:

```lean
  f argumentOne argumentTwo
  + g argumentOne argumentTwo
  + h argumentOne argumentTwo
```

Consecutive operators with the same parser binding powers are formatted as one
chain, even when their spellings differ, such as alternating `+` and `-`.
Chained pipe projections use the same peer layout, with every `|>.member`
continuation at one base.
The same leading-operator layout applies inside an indented declaration body:

```lean
def equality : Prop :=
  veryLongLeftHandSideExpressionWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
  = veryLongRightHandSideExpressionWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
```

A multiline operand needs a visible local hierarchy. A match keeps its normal
internal arm indentation, but the whole block moves inward when it is the
non-final operand of an infix expression:

```lean
  match value with
    | first => firstResult
    | second => secondResult
  + other
```

The formatter describes this with a segment's **head indentation** and **tail
indentation**:

- A segment starts at a physical column. Its head indentation is the nearest
  indentation column at or after that start column.
- Its tail indentation is the minimum indentation for later lines when the
  segment becomes multiline.
- A non-final infix operand lifts its tail one level beyond the following
  operator. Other infix-like syntax and flow layout use the same principle.

When a segment begins between indentation columns, its head rounds up. This
keeps a nested block clear of the following operator:

```lean
  -> match value with
        | first => firstResult
        | second => secondResult
      ∧ other
```

Tail indentation is a floor, not an amount added to every rule indentation. An
application already asks for one continuation level, so a tail at that level
does not push it farther:

```lean
  someFunction firstLongArgument
    nextArgument
  + g
```

The floor accumulates through nested non-final operands. This makes each inner
operator deeper than the operator containing it, while the application keeps
its own continuation relationship:

```lean
  someFunction firstLongArgument
      nextArgument
    + g
  :: h
```

In real code, an application inside `::`, itself inside `++`, follows the same
hierarchy:

```lean
  (Selection.field responseName fieldName arguments fieldDirectives
        fieldSelectionSet
      :: inlineSelectionSet
    ++ rest)
```

Some constructs have several relative indentation levels. A multiline
structure places fields one level inside its braces while its closing brace
returns to the brace level:

```lean
something
+ {
    field1 := value1,
    field2 := value2
  }
  - g
```

When tail indentation raises such a construct, leanfmt shifts the complete
break profile together. It does not independently clamp every line, because
that would flatten the difference between fields and the closing brace:

```lean
-> {
      field1 := value1,
      field2 := value2
    }
    :: g
```

Parentheses stay tight around their expression, and the expression inside owns
the breaks. When a parenthesized chain is a non-final operand, its operators
remain one level deeper than the surrounding chain:

```lean
((executableFieldSelections [first]
    ++ middle
    ++ executableFieldSelections [later])
  ++ suffix)
```

## Propositions and arrows

leanfmt distinguishes the layout role of arrow chains from their syntactic
context:

- arrows in ordinary function types flow and wrap only where required;
- arrows in theorem statements, `Prop` definition bodies, quantifier bodies,
  and logical operands break as a balanced logical group.

```lean
theorem valid
    : FirstCondition
      -> SecondCondition
      -> FinalCondition := by
  exact proof
```

Logical and equality operators recognized for balanced proposition layout are
`->`, `→`, `∧`, `∨`, `/\`, `\/`, and `=`. A lower-precedence outer connector
breaks before nested higher-precedence expressions.

```lean
def leadingEqualityAndOperand : Prop :=
  firstCondition = secondConditionWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
  ∧ thirdConditionWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
  ∧ finalConditionWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
```

`≠` receives normal spacing but is not included in the balanced logical group.

Nested disjunction and conjunction groups retain a visible local hierarchy:

```lean
def parenthesizedDisjunctionChain (schema : Schema) (implementation expected : Name)
    : Prop :=
  (schema.isLeafType implementation
    ∧ schema.isLeafType expected
    ∧ implementation = expected)
  ∨ (schema.isCompositeType implementation
      ∧ schema.isCompositeType expected
      ∧ ∀ objectName,
          schema.typeIncludesObject implementation objectName
          -> schema.typeIncludesObject expected objectName)
```

## Quantifiers and lambdas

A quantifier stays flat when it fits. Otherwise its body begins after the comma
and is indented one level.

```lean
def mixedAdjacentQuantifiers : Prop :=
  ∃ objectType,
    ∀ typeCondition,
      typeCondition ∈ typeConditions
      -> objectType ∈ schema.getPossibleTypes typeCondition
```

Adjacent quantifiers of the same kind do not add another indentation level
between them:

```lean
def adjacentQuantifiers : Prop :=
  ∀ x, ∀ y, body x y
```

Different quantifiers add a level when their bodies wrap:

```lean
def mixedAdjacentQuantifiers : Prop :=
  ∃ objectType,
    ∀ typeCondition,
      predicate objectType typeCondition
```

Long binder sequences can flow between binders and between names belonging to
one untyped binder sequence.

```lean
∃ leftPrefixFields leftPrefixErrors rightPrefixFields rightPrefixErrors
    leftSuffixFields leftSuffixErrors rightSuffixFields rightSuffixErrors,
  predicate
```

Source breaks between fitting adjacent quantifiers are not preserved merely
because they appeared in the input.

Binder operators such as `⨆`, `⨅`, `∑`, and `∫` use the same comma/body
layout. This rule is recognized from the operator token and syntax shape, so
generated notation node names do not need individual mappings. Decorated forms
such as `∀ᵉ` share the classification of their base operator. A trailing
notation suffix after the body, such as `∂μ` on an integral, stays with the body
and does not move the comma/body break. When an extended binder's type wraps,
the `:` stays with the first line of the type.

```lean
⨆ p : Index,
  ∑ i ∈ Finset.range p.size, value p i
```

A lambda breaks after `=>` and indents its body one level:

```lean
fun objectType =>
  normalizeSelectionSet schema objectType selections
```

## `let` expressions

A `let` body always begins on a separate line. A long right-hand side begins
after `:=` with one additional indentation level:

```lean
def withLet : Result :=
  let normalizedSubselections :=
    normalizeSelectionSet schema returnType mergedSubselections
  normalizedSubselections
```

The body aligns with `let`, not with the right-hand side. When a `let` appears
after a leading operator, leanfmt may insert alignment space before `let` so the
result also satisfies Lean's indentation-sensitive parser.

For a layout-delimited `let`, Lean must be able to tell where the right-hand
side ends and the body begins. When the body starts with syntax that could also
be another function argument, leanfmt aligns `let` to an indentation column.
This may retain a space after an opening parenthesis:

```lean
result
  = ( let matching :=
        computeMatchingSelections schema responseName selections
      useMatchingSelections matching)
```

When the leading syntax cannot continue a function application, the body
boundary is already unambiguous and the opening parenthesis remains tight.
Examples include bodies starting with `match`, `if`, `let`, or `by`:

```lean
result
  = (let collectedRest :=
        collectRest selections
      match lookupField fieldName with
      | none => collectedRest
      | some field => field :: collectedRest)
```

leanfmt asks Lean's active term parser this question at function-argument
precedence. Syntax extensions declared or imported by a project therefore
follow their own declared precedence instead of a built-in keyword list.

An explicitly semicolon-delimited `let` does not depend on indentation for this
boundary and keeps tight parenthesis spacing.

A structured right-hand side keeps its own layout below `:=`:

```lean
def letMatchRhs : Result :=
  let current :=
    match selection with
    | .field responseName fieldName => collectField responseName fieldName
    | .inlineFragment selectionSet => collectFields selectionSet
  current
```

Monadic bindings follow the same header/RHS split. Both identifier and pattern
bindings keep `←` on the header and break after it when necessary:

```lean
let (normalizedSource, normalizeMs) ←
  timeIO <| pure <| normalize source
```

A `suffices` body likewise begins on a separate line after the proposition and
its `from` proof. The body remains offside from the proof expression so Lean's
layout parser cannot absorb it into that expression.

A `have` body also begins on a separate line. When its declaration does not fit,
the assigned value breaks after `:=` while the following body remains aligned
with the `have` expression rather than the assigned value. A dependent return
type that begins with `have` owns its layout base after the signature colon, so
both its proof and following type stay offside after the signature is reflowed.

When `have` is the right operand of a broken low-priority pipe, it uses the same
mandatory start alignment as `let`. The operator stays with the first line of
the `have` expression, and the expression and its body share one aligned base:

```lean
def pipeHave :=
  longFunctionNameWithEnoughCharactersToForceLowPriorityPipeBreak
  <|  have value := 0
      value
```

When a `by` proof is the right operand of `<|`, the introducer remains attached
to the operator and its body starts one level below the surrounding expression
base:

```lean
theorem pipedProof : True :=
  id <| by
    exact True.intro
```

A `have` that contains a protected proof body moves with the complete `<|`
right-operand group so the proof and its following body continue to move as one
layout island.
When the final proof argument of `have`, `suffices`, or another tactic contains
a structural `cases` or `induction`, the tactic header remains protected while
the proof body exposes the existing elimination layout. Nested alternative
bodies therefore receive the same two-level indentation as a direct
elimination tactic.

## Conditionals

A fitting conditional stays on one line. A multiline conditional breaks as a
balanced branch structure:

```lean
if responseName == group.fst then
  (responseName, fields ++ group.snd) :: rest
else
  (responseName, fields) :: addExecutableGroup group rest
```

An `else if` keeps the nested `if` on the `else` line rather than adding an
extra branch indentation. The complete chain is one balanced structure: if one
branch boundary breaks, every `then` branch and the final `else` branch break
together.

```lean
if firstCondition then
  firstResult
else if secondCondition then
  secondResult
else
  finalResult
```

Accepted source breaks between branch boundaries can keep an intentional
multiline conditional even when a flatter form fits. Because conditionals are
non-flow rules, any accepted branch break activates the complete balanced
branch layout.

Conditionals normally start on an indentation boundary. An immediately preceding
opening parenthesis keeps tight spacing instead; branch indentation rounds up from
the off-column `if`. This exception affects only the first line:

```lean
pure
  (if firstCheck && secondCheck && thirdCheck && fourthCheck then
      0
    else
      1)
```

Thus an input that breaks only before `else` does not remain half-broken:

```lean
if arg.startsWith "-" then
  .error s!"unknown option: {arg}"
else
  loop options (FilePath.mk arg :: files) rest
```

An infix-like condition with a bar-separated right operand, such as `matches`,
keeps its first alternative with the leading operator. Later alternatives are
packed while they fit and their bars align with that first alternative:

```lean
if kind
    matches `Monotone | `Antitone | `StrictMono
            | `StrictAnti | `MonotoneOn then
  true
else
  false
```

## Match expressions and equation arms

Match alternatives start on their own lines and align with the `match` keyword:

```lean
match variableValues with
| [] => none
| (variableName, value) :: rest =>
    if variableName = name then some value else lookupVariableValue? rest name
```

A long discriminant is formatted by its own rules before `with`:

```lean
match veryLongFunctionName child children additionalArgumentOne
        additionalArgumentTwo with
| [] => 0
| _ :: rest => rest.length
```

Multiple match discriminants are grouped as peers. They use flow layout with
breaks after commas, aligned under the first discriminant following `match`, so
only the suffix that does not fit moves:

```lean
match defaultPresentChildIndexBefore? segment index,
      defaultPresentChildIndexAfter? segment index,
      defaultPresentChildIndexAround? segment index with
| some before,
  some after,
  some around => result
```

When an explicit motive precedes the discriminants, a wrapped discriminant uses
the `match` base instead of inheriting the motive's ending column:

```lean
match (motive := (x : Input) → Property x → Result) x,
  proofOfProperty x with
| value, proof => result
```

Multiple patterns in one arm are balanced peers. If a pattern boundary breaks,
all comma-separated pattern boundaries break together. A long right-hand side
breaks after `=>` and is indented two levels from the arm start:

```lean
| .field responseName fieldName arguments directives selectionSet =>
    collectFields schema responseName fieldName arguments directives selectionSet
```

Pattern lists also flow when they become too long:

```lean
| parentType,
  _source,
  .field responseName fieldName arguments directives selectionSet =>
    body
```

Short right-hand sides stay on the arrow line. A `by` or `do` right-hand side
also stays attached to `=>`, and its nested body owns subsequent breaks.

```lean
| .some value => do
    process value
| .none => by
    exact defaultValue
```

Equation-style declaration arms follow the same alternative layout.

Tactic alternatives that own a body after `=>` use the same two-level body
indentation. An arrowless tactic alternative owns only its pattern; subsequent
tactics remain peers in the surrounding tactic sequence because indenting them
under the alternative changes Lean's parse. The owned indentation remains
structural when a protected, unbreakable proof line becomes longer than the
configured width after moving to that column.

`cases` and `induction` keep `with` on the complete header. Their alternatives
align with the tactic, and a multiline alternative body is indented two levels
beneath it:

```lean
theorem example (value : Nat) : True := by
  cases value with
  | zero =>
      exact True.intro
  | succ value =>
      exact True.intro
```

A long `induction ... generalizing` header wraps between generalized identifiers.
The target remains attached to `induction`, and the final identifier remains
attached to `with`:

```lean
  induction path generalizing leftVariableDefinitions
      rightVariableDefinitions
      leftCurrentSelectionSet
      rightCurrentSelectionSet leftFuel rightFuel with
  | nil => trivial
```

A pattern lambda uses its own physical start as the arm base. When `fun` starts
between indentation boundaries, as after an opening parenthesis, the arms round
up to the next boundary rather than inheriting the enclosing expression's base:

```lean
applyHandler
  (fun
    | .none => defaultValue
    | .some value => process value)
```

Alternative patterns are grouped as peers before rendering, like operands in
an infix chain. This lets multiple `|` patterns wrap in a balanced layout at
the arm base instead of inheriting accidental nesting from the raw parser
tree. A pattern alias such as `fieldSelection@(` stays attached; if its nested
pattern must wrap, the break occurs inside the parentheses before the arm's
`=>` body layout is considered.

Indentation is relative to the arm's logical base, even when the enclosing
expression starts at a shifted physical column. The formatter does not align
continuations under an incidental token column. Comments between a pattern,
separator, and body remain attached to their source tokens and are reindented
with the resulting arm rather than changing which rule wins.

## `do` expressions

`do` remains attached to the expression that introduces it, and statements
start one level below it:

```lean
def run : IO Unit := do
  IO.println "start"
  IO.println "done"
```

Statement boundaries are structural and remain on separate lines.

A semicolon explicitly joins adjacent statements. If the complete sequence
fits, it may remain on one line even when the source broke after `;`:

```lean
IO.println usage; pure 0
```

If it does not fit, the do-sequence rules provide the normal balanced
statement boundaries.

A refutable `let` with a fallback treats its value and fallback as separate
branches. A multiline value begins one level below `:=`; `|` aligns with
`let`, as required by Lean's layout parser:

```lean
let .some value :=
  lookupVeryLongValue firstArgument secondArgument thirdArgument
| return none
consume value
```

If only the fallback is long, the value can remain on the header while the
break occurs before `|`:

```lean
let .some value := candidate
| recoverVeryLongValue firstArgument secondArgument thirdArgument
consume value
```

The successful continuation also aligns with `let`. Formatting inside the
value and fallback remains the responsibility of their own expression rules.
When the fallback is a multiline `do` sequence, its statements begin one level
beneath `|`, while the successful continuation returns to the `let` column. This
applies to both `←` and `:=` fallback declarations:

```lean
let some value ← candidate
| -- Recover locally.
  let fallback ← recover
  return fallback
consume value
```

```lean
let some value := candidate
| do
    reportFailure
    return none
consume value
```

## Subtypes

A subtype stays compact when it fits:

```lean
{ target : ScopedField // target ∈ fields }
```

When it does not fit, it breaks before `//`:

```lean
{ targetField : ScopedFieldVeryLongTypeNameLikeThis
  // targetField ∈ targetFieldsWithVeryLongName }
```

The property can then use ordinary proposition layout.

Set builders keep the opening delimiter, binder, and `|` in one header. When the
predicate does not fit, it breaks after `|`, and a detached closing delimiter
aligns with `{`:

```lean
{ value |
  firstLongCondition value
    ∧ secondLongCondition value
}
```

## Arrays, tuples, anonymous constructors, and structure instances

Single-line collections remain compact:

```lean
[firstItem, secondItem, thirdItem]
(firstValue, secondValue)
{ data := .null, errors := 1 }
```

Multi-item arrays, tuples, and anonymous constructors use balanced layout: when
the collection does not fit, the opening boundary, every item boundary, and the
closing delimiter break together.

```lean
[
  veryLongFirstArrayItemNameUsedForLayoutTesting,
  veryLongSecondArrayItemNameUsedForLayoutTesting,
  veryLongThirdArrayItemNameUsedForLayoutTesting
]
```

A protected proof body does not protect its surrounding anonymous constructor.
When the proof retains a source line break, the constructor still applies its
balanced item and closing-delimiter breaks around that proof.

For generated two-operand notation, a comma-like trailing separator remains
attached to the first operand and the continuation starts after it:

```lean
custom⟪firstVeryLongOperand,
  secondVeryLongOperand⟫
```

leanfmt does not add a trailing comma.

A single multiline item keeps an outer list compact around that item. This
supports common nested forms such as a list containing one structure value:

```lean
[{
  parentType := parentType,
  responseName := responseName,
  fieldName := fieldName
}]
```

An `#[...]` array literal uses balanced delimiters when its singleton item is
multiline. Existing balanced source breaks are also retained when array items
carry authored comments.

An atom ending in an opening delimiter is treated as that delimiter for line
layout. This keeps prefixed forms such as `#[...]` balanced even when the first
item begins with a normally tight token such as `(`.

Structure instances with several fields break after `{`, between fields, and
before `}`. Comma-separated fields remain flat when they fit. Newline-separated
fields without commas are structurally multiline because Lean's layout syntax
requires those boundaries.

A field value introduced by `by` or `do` keeps that introducer with `:=`, just
as a declaration value does. The body breaks after the introducer:

```lean
{
  map value := by
    exact proof
}
```

Multiple sources in a structure update align as peers before the `with` suffix:

```lean
{
  firstParent,
  secondParent with
    field := value
}
```

The opening and closing brace breaks are balanced. A type ascription following a
multiline structure keeps `:` with its type:

```lean
response
  = ({
        data := ResponseValue.object fields,
        errors := errors
      }
      : Response)
```

A fitting constructor remains completely flat, including a nested constructor
used as a field value. If a constructor argument is too wide, its containing
application breaks before `{`. In a declaration body, the declaration first
uses its normal break after `:=`; only then does the constructor apply its own
field breaks. This avoids splitting a short constructor merely because the
source happened to break inside it.

```lean
def recordOperand :=
  {
    parentType := validParentWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting,
    responseName := responseNameWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting
  }
```

A multiline tuple uses the same balanced opening, item, and closing shape:

```lean
def tupleOperand :=
  (
    firstItemNameWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting,
    secondItemNameWithEnoughCharactersForLayoutTesting,
  )
```

Existing punctuation is preserved, so the trailing comma above remains because
it was present in the source; leanfmt does not add one.

Anonymous constructors use the same balanced shape. Single-field constructors
remain flat when they fit.

```lean
def setoidWitness :=
  ⟨
    fun a b => related a b,
    fun a => ⟨refl a⟩,
    fun h => h.symm,
    fun h₁ h₂ => h₁.trans h₂
  ⟩
```

Structure updates follow the same field layout:

```lean
def normalizeOperation (schema : Schema) (operation : Operation) : Operation :=
  {
    operation with
      selectionSet :=
        normalizeSelectionSet schema operation.rootType operation.selectionSet
  }
```

The update source is one level inside the braces, and fields are one level
inside the `with` header. A short update remains flat, such as
`{ operation with selectionSet := selectionSet }`.

## Unknown and custom syntax

Every parser token remains present even when leanfmt has no explicit rule for a
syntax node. The generic rule examines only the node's immediate child shape:

- a token between two child nodes is treated as an infix-like break point;
- otherwise, boundaries between present children become flow break points;
- token spelling is not used to guess the meaning of the syntax.

This provides conservative wrapping for long custom syntax without pretending
to understand it. Formatting developers can use `--check-exception` to identify
syntax that deserves an explicit rule.

A generated term node with exactly three present children whose first and last
children are the same atom is treated as a symmetric delimited term. Its
delimiters stay attached while the enclosed expression applies its own layout.
This covers notation such as `|x|` and `‖x‖` without enumerating delimiter
spellings. Generated postfix term nodes likewise keep their final atom attached
to the preceding expression while that expression applies its own layout.

A generated prefix-index term is recognized when its immediate opening atom
ends in `[`, a later immediate atom is `]`, and an operand follows that closing
delimiter. It may break inside the index or before following operands, but never
before the closing `]`. Requiring immediate atoms keeps this delimiter-shape
recognition from inspecting an operand's nested token spelling. Trailing
separator tokens inside the brackets do not introduce break points. A generated
three-child delimiter wrapper with no following operand remains an ordinary
delimited term.

Unknown syntax is lossless, but its whitespace is not guaranteed to remain
byte-for-byte unchanged. Multiline custom braced term syntax is a conservative
exception: leanfmt keeps its source layout instead of canonicalizing indentation for
an extension-owned DSL.

A short custom syntax declaration can remain flat:

```lean
syntax "widget" : term
```

If a larger custom node overflows, its parser-child boundaries determine the
generic wrapping until leanfmt has a dedicated rule for that syntax.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics observe source without changing formatting behavior. The compact
bang diagnostic reports `!f a b` because it can be read as either compact
negation or a function application.

These spellings are accepted and preserved:

```lean
!value
! value
! f a b
! (f a b)
```

The ambiguous `!f a b` spelling is reported but not automatically rewritten.

## Formatting guarantees

leanfmt is designed around these checks:

1. Parsing succeeds with Lean's parser and active syntax extensions.
2. Reconstructing the syntax tree reproduces the parsed source.
3. Formatting preserves the code-token sequence and the exact text inside comments;
   whitespace between code and comment fragments is normalized for comparison.
4. Formatting is idempotent: formatting the output again produces the same
   output.

The third and fourth properties are available as internal CLI checks for
formatter development. They describe formatter correctness, not style options
that ordinary users need to select.

Formatting may require more than one parse/render pass because a first layout
can expose a different accepted source-break shape to the next pass. leanfmt
iterates to a fixed point with a hard limit of four passes. If an intermediate
result does not parse, repeats a previously seen result, or does not converge
within that limit, leanfmt emits a warning and returns the original source
rather than treating the fallback as a hard formatter error.
